Emerald was founded in 2010 by two scientists and life-long friends from Philadelphia with a singular vision of how a biotechnology company should run.  Frustrated by the continual deceleration of innovation and the exponentially increasing R&D costs in the pharmaceutical sector, Emerald models itself after the legendary start-up companies of the mid-20th century that built the core technologies underlying the meteoric rise of the semiconductor industry. The team places as much focus on building tools around how scientific research is conducted as they do on their proprietary anti-viral therapies.  In this way, Emerald is striving to bring a Mooreâ€™s law-like acceleration to life sciences innovation.
