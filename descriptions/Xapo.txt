At Xapo, they believe that bitcoin’s ultimate success will be based on trust – whether individuals trust the digital currency’s stability and whether they trust the industry’s security. That’s why we’ve assembled a team of financial services and security experts to build an entirely new bitcoin storage experience. By offering two distinct products – an easy access wallet and a locked-down vault – they’re marrying the convenience bitcoin users want for everyday needs with the security they require for confident bitcoin saving. It’s the most secure, the reliable, and the most convenient. That’s something we can all trust in.
