A solar panel that tracks the sun throughout the day produces up to 30% more electricity than one that does not. Solar project developers install single-axis tracking for most utility-scale sites, balancing upfront costs versus electricity revenues to maximize rates of return. QBotix disrupts today's cost curve of fixed-tilt, single-axis tracking, and dual-axis tracking with an innovative tracking solution that offers dual-axis tracking at single-axis price. This reduces the levelized cost of energy by 10-20% while providing the added benefit of higher reliability and system intelligence.
