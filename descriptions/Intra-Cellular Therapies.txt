Intra-Cellular Therapies (ITI) is developing novel drugs for the treatment of neuropsychiatric and neurologic diseases and other disorders of the Central Nervous System (CNS).

We combine the efforts of medicinal chemists, pharmacologists, biologists and clinical development scientists into a vibrant team that translates world-class research expertise into novel drugs. The company's lead product, ITI-007 is a novel first-in-class 5-HT2A antagonist, Dopamine receptor phosphoprotein modulator (DPPM) designed to treat multiple deficits in patients with schizophrenia while lacking the side-effects of existing antipsychotic drugs.

ITI has also developed a state of the art technology platform, called CNSProfileâ„¢ that is capable of generating a unique molecular signature for drug compounds. This profile provides us with a proprietary window into the intracellular action of CNS drugs or drug candidates. We use this tool to fingerprint the intracellular molecular actions of existing drugs and to drive our internal drug discovery and development.

Our technology has also enabled the company to examine the toxic effects of brain damaging nerve agents, and as a result, we are involved in collaborative efforts with several military and contract organizations to develop antidotes to chemical warfare agents.

Based upon our understanding of the Central Nervous System we have discovered novel drug candidates with promise for treating the panoply of symptoms associated with the transition from peri-menopausal to post-menopausal states.

Intra-Cellular Therapies was founded in 2002 by Drs. Paul Greengard, Sharon Mates and Allen Fienberg. The company is headquartered in New York City.
