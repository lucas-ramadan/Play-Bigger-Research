WageWorks administers voluntary employee benefits like health-savings, COBRA, and flexible-spending accounts. WageWorks is riding a trend where employers are giving their employees more benefit options and need to explain and administer these options - which it outsourced to WageWorks. The company operates the site ForYourFinancialHealth.com to make this happen. WageWorks reported revenues of $14.4M in 2004 and a 2100% revenue growth rate between 2001 and 2004. It has made several recent acquisitions: HCap Strategies, FBD Consulting, Sodexho Pass, and FlexBen. Clients include over 75 of the Fortune 500 including: Bank of America, The Bank of New York, Leggett & Platt, Limited Brands, Pfizer, Tribune Company, Union Pacific, and The US Postal Service.
