At Pluto Media we integrate brilliant technology with world-class creative talent to develop products that foster children's creativity, curiosity, and knowledge of the world around them.

We are very excited about the huge opportunity in the kids' social fun learning space created by tablets and smartphones with intuitive interfaces. We are well-funded, incredibly well-advised, and perfectly positioned to capture this space.

Pluto Media was founded in YouWeb Incubator, birthplace of wildly successful gaming companies such as OpenFeint (recently acquired for $104M by GREE), CrowdStar, iSwifter and Sibblingz Spaceport. The company was also an inaugural member of co.lab, an accelerator focused on educational gaming companies with very high-growth potential.
