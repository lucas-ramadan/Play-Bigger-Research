Weâ€™re an independent PC online game studio that wants to create fun. We believe that fun games challenge us, reward us, and connect us to our friends. Exploration leads to inspiration. Passion leads to mastery. Great games are fun every step of the way.

Our story began in August 2010 with a mission: make core game experiences that are accessible and fun. Since early 2012, we've been heads-down working on an exciting new PC online game. While we can't share any more about our current project, we've assembled some of the top talents in the industry, and all of us are pouring our passion into it every day.
