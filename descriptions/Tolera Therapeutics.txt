Tolera Therapeutics Inc., founded under the scientific and medical direction of Maria Siemionow, M.D., Ph.D., D.Sc., is a spin-off of the Cleveland Clinic focused on bringing more specific, and safer therapies to market with competitive speed.

The companyâ€™s technology stems from immune modulation and transplant research done at the Cleveland Clinic under the leadership of Dr. Siemionow, an internationally recognized leader in the fields of microsurgery and transplantation. In addition to her surgical skills, she has focused her research efforts on the development of therapies to promote life-long acceptance of organ and tissue transplants, while reducing or eliminating the need for chronic immunosuppression therapies and their dangerous side effects. In addition, Dr. Siemionowâ€™s efforts have led to new discoveries in immune system modulation. She has authored and contributed to over 180 peer reviewed articles on transplantation, immune suppression and organ tolerance.
