At Spruce, we’re passionate about building a better way to see the doctor. We think getting great health care in America involves too much waiting and hassle. Healthcare pricing should be affordable and involve no surprises. We think the experience of “going to the doctor” can be dramatically improved for both patients and physicians through easy-to-use software to enrich the patient-physician relationship and improve quality, safety, and satisfaction.
