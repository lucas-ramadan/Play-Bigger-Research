LiveSafeâ€™s mission is to create a safer world by redefining the way we respond to threats and emergencies. Using the latest in smartphone technology, our service empowers people by providing them with access to the right tools and information they need, right when they need it.

Our unprecedented technology connects citizens and safety officials through a real-time, two-way communication system. The robust application allows people to easily receive and send important safety information to law enforcement, who can then respond to situations better and faster than ever before.

By engaging the whole community in a social network of safety, our student and citizen-centered design takes policing to the next generation. We believe that together, individuals and first-responders can collaborate to build truly safer communities, and we can all live in a more enjoyable world.
