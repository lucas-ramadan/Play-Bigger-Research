Our History

In 2001, we changed the way companies assess top talent.

Based on over 25 years of research in job competency modeling, we pioneered a data-driven approach that makes candidate assessments quicker, more cost effective and most importantly, more predictive of success.

We’ve had the privilege of helping some remarkable organizations – from leading hospitals to Fortune 500 companies – find the right people.

Created by our fantastic team of experts and scientists, our library of hundreds of job-specific surveys and our predictive talent analytics software has helped hundreds of organizations hire smarter.
