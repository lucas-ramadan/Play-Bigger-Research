Skycure revolutionizes the way mobile devices are protected, by introducing an active mobile security solution that addresses emerging security threats without compromising functionality, usability or battery life. Skycure enables organizations to embrace the BYOD (bring your own device) trend, but still provide strong protection and control.

Skycure's patent-pending technology employs a dual protection mechanism, which consists of a client-side module that resides on the device and protects it 24/7, together with a server-side service that provides heavy lifting analysis. The solution monitors security threats and provides a smart and selective protection accordingly. Skycure’s research team is accredited with cutting edge publications, ensuring our solution is always ready for future threats (for more details: http://blog.skycure.com).

Skycure was founded in 2012 by Adi Sharabani and Yair Amit, two Unit 8200 veterans (U.S. National Security Agency equivalent), who possess extensive and proven technological and managerial experience in the security industry. The company is funded by Pitango Venture Capital and Michael Weider, a known figure in the application security world, who acts as a proactive advisor to the company’s Board of Directors.
