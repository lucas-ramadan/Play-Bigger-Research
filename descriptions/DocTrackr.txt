Each time you share a digital document, the minute you've sent it, you are no longer in control.
docTrackr helps businesses keep their documents under control, wherever they're stored, whomever they're shared with - i.e. you can remotely destroy them, update them and know what people are doing with them in real-time.

doctrackr's technology was designed to protect the most sensitive documents in business. docTrackr provides advanced document intelligence and control, giving enterprises complete visibility into document usage. With docTrackr, managers can control permissions, track usage, and even destroy documents remotely. All through all through an easy to use dashboard.

They are complementary to document management platforms such as Dropbox, Box.net or Google Drive. docTrackr continues to provide a benefit to their users even once the documents are extracted from their platform and redistributed.

docTrackr was part of TechStars – #1 startup accelerator in the world – and is based in the USA (Boston – MA) and in Europe (Paris – France; Bucharest – Romania), and backed by Polaris Ventures and Atlas Ventures.

It was acquired by Intralinks.com for $10 million dollars cash.
