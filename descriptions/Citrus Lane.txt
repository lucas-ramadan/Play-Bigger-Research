Citrus Lane is the leading online and mobile platform connecting moms with brands and advice they can trust. Citrus Lane combines community, content, and commerce to create the trusted destination for parents to discover and buy the best products for their kids. Moms are busier than ever before and are looking for a trusted and convenient source for products for their children. Citrus Lane meets the needs of mom in three ways. First, we deliver a monthly subscription box that helps moms discover new products and brands. Second, we offer a full e-commerce offering, which enables subscribers to "add to box" each month, and community members and subscribers to buy "best of" products at citruslane.com. Third, we have a highly engaged community who reviews and votes on products and shares advice by stage.
