Although it accounts for fewer than two percent of all skin cancer cases, melanoma is responsible for the majority of deaths.  A diagnosis of melanoma is even more serious if the disease has spread beyond the initial site (metastatic melanoma). Nearly one million people in the United States are afflicted with the disease. Making matters worse, there is no cure for metastatic melanoma. Historically, five-year mortality is 90 percent.
