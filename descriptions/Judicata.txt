Judicata is mapping the legal genomeâ€”i.e. using highly specialized case law parsing and algorithmically assisted human review to turn unstructured court opinions into structured data. We are leveraging that data to build legal research and analytics tools that are an order of magnitude better than existing offerings. Great legal technology will never replace lawyers, but it can help them make sense of massive amounts of information and aid them in exercising their skilled, human judgment.
