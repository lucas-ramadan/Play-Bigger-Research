Much of the world's cargo travels from port to port and then on to rail and road in more than 20 million containers.  Today only 77,000 containers are actively tracked.  By 2016 this number is expected to increase to 1 million.   

Through the Weft platform, which integrates with Weft sensors as well as sensors from other providers, and with ERP and CRM systems, users log in to get the current status and to set alerts for out-of-bounds conditions (location, temperature, moisture, shock/vibration) and stages completed.  Through predictive analytics, Weft takes the current location and planned route of all shipments on the platform and combines this information with historical data to identify likely bottlenecks and alert shippers to potential problems before they occur.  Shippers can then adjust routes and schedules to increase the likelihood of on-time delivery.  

Weft is available through ERP providers, telecommunications companies, and shipping and logistics companies.  

The company is participating at SAP TechEd in Las Vegas on October 21, 2013.
