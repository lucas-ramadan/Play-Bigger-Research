Authorea.com is a collaborative platform to write, share, and discuss research. It was created by a Harvard astrophysicist and a Berkeley physicist who met while working at CERN and were disappointed by the slow, inefficient, and obsolete ways by which research papers are written and disseminated. Described by many as a hybrid between Google Docs and Github for science, Authorea is a modern, web-native, Git-based environment where research findings are published, reviewed, and consumed openly. It is currently used by tens of thousand of researchers in the hard sciences and is rapidly growing in new research disciplines, in and outside of academia. Authorea increases the pace of scientific research, facilitates collaboration and data-sharing, and rewards transparency, with the mission to restore public trust in science. At Authorea, they believe that the best research is collaborative, rigorous, transparent, and accessible.
