Mobiplex is a revolutionary venture specializing in mobile and wireless sports performance technology, based on miniature wireless sensors and mobile device apps, that helps athletes improve their skill levels for better enjoyment of the game. 

In September 2012, Mobiplex launched its first product, the SwingTIP Golf Swing Analyzer—an innovative Bluetooth-enabled 3D motion sensor device that clips onto a golf club to analyze and capture a golf swing in three dimensions. SwingTIP helps golfers improve their swing by sending real-time visual and performance data to an iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad or Android™ device and MySwingTIP.com. 

Mobiplex has developed a proprietary ProView™ Motion Analysis™ engine that can accurately capture, analyze and digitally reproduce a sports motion in three dimensions. The company will employ this IP to develop wireless and mobile sports performance technology for all types of Bluetooth app-cessories for various sports - beyond golf.

The Mobiplex founders have a combined 10 patents in biomechanics, wireless technology, motion sensing, technology and pattern recognition. 

The Mobiplex management team has a strong track record of building numerous startup companies and business units from inception to major industry successes. The team is well represented in all areas – wireless and mobile technology, manufacturing, sales and marketing, operations and golf.
