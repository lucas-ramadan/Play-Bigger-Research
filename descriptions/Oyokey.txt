Talk to the Internet: Oyokey finally makes Voice Browsing possible thanks to a new keyword –based addressing system.

Voice Browsing:
Now you can navigate the Internet as easily with your voice as you can with a mouse. Oyokey has invented a new protocol that transcends the limits of pre-coded voice systems and gives you unlimited direct access to anything on the Internet. With Oyokey, you can literally browse the web just by talking. Your voice now has infinite power.

KiTag Keyword Addressing:
Voice Browsing is made possible thanks to our new address system that tags keywords to URLs. These Keyword Identifier Tags (kiTags) give the user direct and accurate access to an unlimited amount of information and functionality. It’s a cloud-based system that allows the user to navigate the entire Internet through all current devices and emerging engagement platforms such as cars, wearables, and TVs. With a string of keywords tagged to a URL, there is no limit to the information that can be directly accessed or actions that can be triggered.
