History and Vision

WorkingPoint founders worked for Intuit and were behind the creation of QuickBooks and Quicken. They believe Quickbooks had become too complicated and that the small business software segment was ripe for SaaS-based innovation. Tom Proulx, WorkingPoint Chairman, and Tate Holt, CEO, were passionately committed to creating a complete small business product that is well-integrated, simple to use, and of very high quality. WorkingPoint launched a comprehensive software package that fulfilled that commitment in July of 2009 and has been adding additional high-value features since. We’re based in San Francisco and venture-backed by CMEA.
