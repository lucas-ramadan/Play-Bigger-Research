Mention Mobile is a young innovative development company that specializes in incorporating real friends into casual social games on facebook & mobile devices.

The company started with an e-mail and developed into what would be an important partnership between Ryan Ozonian, current CEO and co-founder of Mention Mobile, and Mark Cuban, businessman, investor and owner of the Dallas Mavericks.

Today, the start-up has released a number of games including Word Derby, a Chillingo-published multi-player word race that has topped numerous categorical charts in the iTunes store.
