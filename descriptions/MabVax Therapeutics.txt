MabVax is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the commercialization of proprietary anti-cancer immunotherapies resulting from two integrated and successful technology platforms. The first is a series of vaccines developed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and licensed to MabVax. Two of the company’s lead cancer vaccines are currently undergoing proof of concept Phase II multi-center clinical trials for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma and ovarian cancer. Both trials have received $2MM or more in federal grant monies. The second is a human antibody discovery platform developed internally and based on the protective immune responses generated from patients who have been successfully immunized against targeted cancers with the licensed vaccines. The company’s lead human antibody candidate is undergoing preclinical evaluation for development against colon, pancreatic and breast cancers and has received $1.1MM in federal grant monies.
