BookBub helps millions of readers discover great deals on acclaimed ebooks while providing leading publishers and authors a way to drive sales and find new fans.

BookBub is a free daily email that notifies you about deep discounts on acclaimed ebooks. You choose the types you'd like to get notified about — with categories ranging from mysteries to cookbooks — and they send great deals in those genres to your inbox.

BookBub doesn't actually sell books. They simply alert you by email to fantastic limited-time offers that become available on retailers like Amazon's Kindle store, Barnes & Noble's Nook store, Apple's iBookstore, and others. Book publishers offer deals at these sites for promotional purposes, and their staff works with them to determine the best ones to feature to their members.
