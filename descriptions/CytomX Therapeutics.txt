CytomX Therapeutics is an early stage, privately-funded biotechnology company developing Probodiesâ„¢, proteolytically-activated antibodies. Probodies, by their ability to site-direct the activity of antibodies, will result in an improved therapeutic index for validated targets as well enable the drugging of targets with broad tissue expression. Our mission, alone and with the help of partners, is to provide patients with more effective and less toxic therapies for severe illnesses such as cancer and inflammatory diseases.
