FuseSource provides enterprise-class open source integration products and services that deliver all the capabilities large enterprises require to achieve “Integration Everywhere,” at a fraction of the cost of traditional vendors. FuseSource makes it practical for enterprises to not only integrate their mission-critical applications and systems in the data center, but also the entire business ecosystem outside the data center: all of the machines, devices, applications and systems distributed at the edge of the enterprise and across the extended enterprise. This ability to achieve “Integration Everywhere” enables enterprises to operate at unprecedented levels of efficiency and business velocity, which translates directly to competitive advantage. FuseSource platforms and products are based on integration and messaging projects from the Apache Software Foundation.
