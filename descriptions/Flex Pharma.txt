There is currently no proven or effective product for muscle cramps and spasms.
Most muscle cramps are not caused by dehydration, lactic acid, electrolyte imbalance, or muscle tightness. That is why popular remedies like sports drinks, bananas, magnesium tablets, and stretching are usually ineffective.
New research has shown that cramps and spasms do not originate in the muscle itself, but are caused instead by a neural mechanism: excessive firing of the motor neurons in the spinal cord that control muscle contraction.
Flex Pharma is developing products to address muscle cramps and spasms by halting repetitive firing of the motor neurons.
Our founders include professors from Harvard Medical School and Rockefeller University (Nobel prize, 2003).
Preliminary testing of Flex Pharmaâ€™s product in humans has shown that it can relieve electrically induced muscle cramps in minutes, and the effect lasts for hours.
