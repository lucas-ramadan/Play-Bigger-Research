RallyPoint was founded in 2012 by two military veterans at Harvard Business School to help make military life better. Backed by two of the US military's recent Joint Chiefs of Staff, RallyPoint connects its members and gives them the best tools possible to succeed both while in the military, and beyond. With RallyPoint, members can build their professional network, connect with other members of the military and veterans in a safe environment, and explore career opportunities both within the military and in the private sector.  In 2012, RallyPoint won the world's largest startup competition (MassChallenge), and placed 2nd in the Harvard Business School Business Plan Competition. RallyPoint was first developed at the Harvard University Innovation Lab and now remains in the Boston area.
