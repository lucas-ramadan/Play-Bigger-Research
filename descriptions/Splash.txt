Splash is a fun way to find and organize experiences by following what people are doing locally. Itâ€™s like an adventure guide curated by your friends, passionate people and experts.

Our mission is to help people discover hidden gems by giving them a snapshot of meaningful experiences shared through the eyes of those who live them, not from the perspective of businesses. We want Splash to be the place people go to unearth the most interesting their city and the world have to offer.
