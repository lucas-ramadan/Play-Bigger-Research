TrustRadius is the leading site for business software users to share real-world insights through in-depth reviews and networking. 

TrustRadius help users make better product selection, implementation, and usage decisions. Every reviewer is authenticated and every review vetted before publishing.

Unlike simple rating sites, TrustRadius reviews are structured and substantive, averaging more than 500 words. Reviewers can also update their reviews to keep them current. Reviews are curated into product comparisons and buyerâ€™s guides. 

Participants in TrustRadius are able to build personal profiles to demonstrate their technology expertise, and earn reputation points as they submit contributions, and as those contributions are "liked" by the community.

TrustRadius was founded in June 2012 by Vinay Bhagat and Dave Hart, formerly Founder/CSO and CTO of Convio, the leading provider of SAAS solutions to nonprofits that went public in 2010 and was acquired in May 2012 for $325m by Blackbaud (BLKB).

Vinay's inspiration for creating TrustRadius was witnessing the significant challenges encountered by team members at Convio in identifying and evaluating business software solutions and services, and the painful consequences of poor choices.
