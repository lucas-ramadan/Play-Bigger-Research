Yaupon Therapeutics, a privately held, specialty pharmaceutical company, is developing a proprietary gel formulation of mechlorethamine hydrochloride for the treatment of early stage (stages I-IIA) mycosis fungoides, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). If approved, Yaupon's investigational drug would be the first topical mechlorethamine gel widely available to treat the signs and symptoms of this rare cancer.
