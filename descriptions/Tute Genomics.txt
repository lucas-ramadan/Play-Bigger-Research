Tute Genomics is a cloud-based clinical genome interpretation platform that enables researchers and clinicians to utilize human genome data for scientific discovery and individualized treatment.

The cost of whole genome sequencing is dropping rapidly and we are at the beginning of a genomics revolution. As genome sequencing becomes standard practice for both clinicians and researchers, the need for user-friendly, accurate and rapid data analysis becomes the major barrier to making important diagnoses and discoveries.

To meet this demand, Tute Genomics has developed the most advanced analytical methods for genome analysis by incorporating proprietary machine-learning algorithms into a cloud based application that allows researchers to analyze & interpret entire human genomes and discover genes and biomarkers at an unprecedented rate.

Tute is opening a new door by helping researchers and clinicians interpret genetic variants and find disease-related genes. Tute is a robust successor to ANNOVAR, the most widely used genome annotation & interpretation technology with over 800 scientific publications.
