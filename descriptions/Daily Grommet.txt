The Grommet is a product launch platform. For a new or indie product, getting noticed is the hardest part.  The Grommet has created a community of early adopters who powerfully move markets for each Grommet.  This is meaningful because getting to scale rapidly is critical to survival for young companies and traditional retail systems are very slow and risk-averse.  They are ripe for disruption. The Grommet community "de risks" a product and provides both qualitative and quantitative lift to its scaling.  In its early days the company launched now-prominent products like IdeaPaint, SodaStream, and Banagrams.  The current Grommet launches are a window on the type of "products with a purpose" that consumers prefer.  After over 2,000 launches, the Grommet is now directly shaping the future of consumer products.
