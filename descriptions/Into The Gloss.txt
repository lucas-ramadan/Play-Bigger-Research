IntoTheGloss.com is a website dedicated to Beauty, from the Inside. No, not from within, although that’s great too—Inside in this case means Inside the fashion industry and on the street. You’ll find influencers from editors to stylists and models divulging their carefully curated products, routines and inspirations. You’ll find makeup artists, hair stylists and myriad other specialists talking about what makes them tick, their top tools, and their visions of what’s to come. You’ll see backstage. You’ll see product highlights. And you’ll see the new kids on the block— the assistants, the up-and-comers—along with the intriguing characters out and about, who are shaping their idea of modern Beauty.
