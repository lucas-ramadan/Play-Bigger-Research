Neoantigenics, LLC is a Virginia-based limited liability company focused on developing oncology theranostics (therapeutic plus diagnostic) products, founded on the novel science around oocyte (egg)-associated cancer neoantigens discovered at the University of Virginia. These neoantigens are uniquely expressed in a wide range of urogenital tract cancers – ovarian, uterine, bladder and renal cancers – as well as certain other solid cancers such as aggressive stages of pancreatic cancer and many head-and-neck cancers.

Our mission aligns with industry trends to develop molecularly-targeted biotherapeutics, in concert with companion diagnostics and imaging agents, to bring to the market precision, personalized cancer therapy solutions.
