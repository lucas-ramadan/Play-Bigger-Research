Fanplayr is an innovative eCommerce solutions company tackling the most important and fundamental challenge in the space - converting a website visitor into a loyal customer.

Fanplayr allows online retailers to know who their visitors are, what they like, what influences their purchase decisions and how they typically respond when presented with an offer.  With this strategy in mind, Fanplayr takes a targeted approach to coupons which is much more effective than the “spray and pray” method that a vast majority of retailers employ.
 
Intelligence and intimate knowledge of consumers gives Fanplayr the ability to deliver real-time, surgically targeted purchase incentives to specific segments of visitor traffic.  With Fanplayr, online retailers can understand their visitors’ intent and deliver the right offer to the right visitor at the right time.

In-depth analytics, dedicated account managers, and in-house industry experts have enabled Fanplayr to improve billions of online shopping experiences.
