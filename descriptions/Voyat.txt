Voyat is the technology company powering direct connections between hotels and customers online and on-property to define a new tier in guest loyalty. Using Voyat’s lightweight platform, hotels can achieve true 1:1 relationships with their guests and present offers, promotions and guest loyalty rewards tailored to every individual. Voyat creates a lasting digital link between every guest or visitor at a hotel property via a WiFi connection to strengthen the direct booking channel and increase customer lifetime value. As a result, the guest is recognized as the valued customer that they are and the brand is able to set itself apart in an overcrowded marketplace to keep those loyal customers coming back.

Leading hotel brands including The New York Palace, Morgan’s Hotel Group, Mövenpick Hotels and many others rely on Voyat technology to enable personalized interactions with their customers which drive higher direct and repeat bookings and define a new tier in guest loyalty. Voyat, founded in 2012 by Benjamin Habbel and Bob Lund, is a global company headquartered in New York City with offices in Barcelona, Spain and clients across North America and EMEA.
