Allpoint helps surveyors and engineers complete 3D projects at unprecedented scale, speed (by an order of magnitude over manual methods) and efficiency. Scanning professionals may be able to use existing visualization tools for smaller projects (e.g., 1,000 feet of pipe, 10 bridges). However, it is much more difficult to effectively and economically meet the rising demands of asset owners when the increasing capabilities of High Definition Scanning (HDS) and Terrestrial Mobile LiDAR Scanning (TMLS) hardware are rapidly raising expectations.
