Palringo is a community messaging and gaming app for iOS and Android. The platform allows users to send instant messages, play games and to form large groups based on common interests. Launched in 2006, Palringo has more than 40 million installed users worldwide and offers a range of games along with more than 350,000 user created groups, some of which have up to 2,000 members. Headquartered in London, Palringo also has offices in Newcastle, Ipswich, Gothenburg and Helsinki.

Users can create and build community groups dedicated to the things they are passionate about, from gaming and entertainment to sports, travel and technology. They can further enhance their experience by using Palringo Credits to purchase virtual products such as rich media sticker packs, Bots and premium groups and accounts. 

Following the acquisition of Swedish game studio, Free Lunch Design, in 2014 and Tribe Studios in 2015, Palringo champions 'Community Gaming' - the integration of gaming capabilities with its instant messaging platform to create community orientated games. Palringo develops both in-app and external games.
