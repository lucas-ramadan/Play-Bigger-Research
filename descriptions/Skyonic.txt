Skyonic Corporation operates as an environmental technology company that converts carbon dioxide emissions to solids for long-term storage. The company offers SkyMine, a post-combustion carbon capture and sequestration technology that addresses the issue of climate change through the mineralization of CO2 as carbonate compounds. Its SkyMine technology removes heavy metals, acid gases, and carbon dioxide from conditioned at-temperature flue gas and stores the carbon emissions as stable sodium bicarbonate for long-term storage as land or mine fill and returns the flue gas to the plants stack for release. The company also provides construction, installation, and maintenance of facilities and equipment. Skyonic was founded in 2005 and is based in Austin, Texas.
