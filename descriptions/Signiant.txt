Signiant is changing the way businesses move large, high-value digital assets around the world and into the cloud. Our software products were originally adopted by Media & Entertainment enterprises, the pioneers in electronic transport of large files. We are the established leader in the space, and most of the world’s mission-critical media workflows — from small post-production houses to Hollywood studios — are powered by Signiant Managers+Agents enterprise software and our SaaS solutions, Media Shuttle and Flight. But Media & Entertainment are no longer alone in the need to send and share massive files. 

Our rapidly growing customer base includes companies with digital assets ranging from satellite imagery and big data analytics to genome sequences. Signiant’s patented and patent pending technologies work to provide: accelerated file delivery up to 200 times faster than standard internet transfers; enterprise-class security along with full visibility and control of transfers, users, and storage; and simple user-friendly tools that don’t get in the way of the creative process. 

At Signiant, we’ve embraced cloud technology to create next-generation SaaS file transfer and cloud upload solutions. Increasingly, businesses want the scalable, reliable, cost effective, and easy to deploy capabilities only found in true SaaS. Whether you prefer enterprise grade on-premises software or cloud-based solutions, Signiant has your large file transfer needs covered.
