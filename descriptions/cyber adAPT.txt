Cyber adAPT®’s technology aims at protecting critical business assets by helping companies detect the presence of sophisticated adversaries hiding inside enterprise networks.Since the majority of available security tools have been deployed to safeguard against anticipated threats rather than alerting on suspicious “inside” activities, Cyber adAPT® is on a mission to not only educate about the growing scope of the threat ecosystem, but also to help ensure that the security postures and practices companies around the world adopt are sufficient and work holistically to protect their digital property as well as their reputation.
