At Kura Oncology, They are committed to realizing the promise of precision medicines for cancer.

The genomics revolution is transforming how they treat cancer. They now understand that how a patient responds to treatment depends in part on the genetic makeup of the cancer and, importantly, we have the knowledge and tools to create targeted treatments and companion diagnostics to identify those patients most likely to benefit. This new era offers the potential for innovative treatments that are safer and more effective for patients with particular cancers.

They are leveraging our insights into cancer genetics as well as our core strength of translating novel science into life-saving medicines to advance a pipeline of precision medicines. Their development programs target cancers with high unmet need, including lung, colorectal, thyroid and pancreatic cancers as well as blood cancers such as lymphoma and leukemias.
