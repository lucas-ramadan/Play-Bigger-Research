tenXer is the company redefining personal productivity by building a platform that allows any employee to analyze their daily work habits. tenXer CEO and Founder Jeff Ma is the inspiration for both the movie 21 and the book Bringing Down the House. Ma created the concept for tenXer when he saw a huge opportunity in the human capital management industry. tenXer focuses first and foremost on the everyday individual worker; the employee opposed to upper management. The company built a proprietary, data-driven platform that enables employees to better understand and improve their work performance, allowing them to be more intrinsically motivated and therefore more productive.
