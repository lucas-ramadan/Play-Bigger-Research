AnaptysBio is a privately-held therapeutic antibody product company and the leader in the use of somatic hypermutation, or SHM, for antibody discovery and optimization.  SHM is the body's natural process for generating potent antibodies to fight disease.  The Company's SHM-Platformâ¢ utilizes the key components of SHM and other techniques to generate antibodies for therapeutic applications through an iterative process of natural evolution and high-throughput selection â a process that has been referred to as ânaturalizingâ antibodies.  This versatile platform can be used both to discover and optimize antibodies directed at specific disease targets and also affinity mature existing antibodies to improve their binding properties.  In addition to providing a more powerful approach to antibody discovery and protein optimization, it addresses a growing void in the therapeutic antibody field due to a string of acquisitions and licensing deals that have reduced the availability of many technologies.
