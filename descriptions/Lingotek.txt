Lingotek | The Translation Network provides opportunities for businesses to expand into global markets by providing Inside Content Management System modules in conjunction with a cloud-based translation management system and professional translation services network. 

Our clients effectively manage translation using an intuitive, cloud-based dashboard. Translators use a completely browser-based translation interface that provides access to all the tools needed to produce high quality translations, including glossaries, style guides, and translation memory. Our software tools and translation services can adapt to fit your content translation needs by matching your timeline and budget to the appropriate workflowâ€”from machine translation post-editing to professional, and everything in between.
