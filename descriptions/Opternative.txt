Opternative is the first online eye exam. Founded with the idea that glasses and contact lens prescriptions should be accessible and affordable, the Opternative Exam is the most convenient way to get a prescription from an ophthalmologist. 

The exam can be taken from anywhere, at anytime, and a doctor issued prescription can be used to shop everywhere. The exam takes roughly 20 minutes and a digital prescription is delivered in 24 hours or less. Opternative is available in 41 states and is now taking patients. 

Eye exams for glasses and contact prescriptions is just the beginning. We envision a world where technology allows patients to connect with doctors to make all aspects of vision care more convenient, accessible and even fun!
