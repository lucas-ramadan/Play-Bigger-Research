Besomebody is the world's first mobile platform that connects people based on shared passions. The #besomebody app is an Experience Marketplace where users can learn anything they are passionate about by booking Experiences with talented people around them. "Passionaries" - the teachers, coaches and instructors on the platform - are independent business owners who set the prices and parameters of their Experiences on the app. Users book directly from their phones, and then both parties meet in person for a hands-on Experience. The Experiences range from learning to ride motorcycles or mountain bikes, to learning to paint or play the piano. Users can also share photos, spark connections and send messages based on their passions. The #besomebody app recently moved out of Beta in Austin, Texas, with over 400 available Experiences and top Passionaries generating over $3K/month in revenue. 

#Besomebody began as one man's mantra in 2009, and is now the fastest-growing and farthest-reaching Motivational Movement in the world, with online and social content now connecting nearly 5 million people in 180 countries. The #besomebody app is available for free download on the App Store. The Android app will be available later this year.
