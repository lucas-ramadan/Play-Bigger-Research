A unified survey platform, for any company using forms on a daily basis. Their target now is into Insurance Brokers and Market Research Companies.

To make forms that have some kind of advanced logic (such as the one required to offer an insurance quote), there is always a need for a developer.

They're replacing the developer from the equation, offering an Apple-like interface and experience, at a price and SLA that can rival easily with the big guys in the industry.

They've seen this face to face during their demos via Skype. When they mention the price, eyebrows are raised since it might be a bit expensive, but after a 30 min demo where they replicate almost any form the customer has, right in front of them, they're immediately sold, and price is no longer the issue :)
