At Chobani, they believe everyone has great taste. They just need great options. In 2005, founder, Hamdi Ulukaya, purchased a deserted plant to bring authentic, delicious yogurt to the masses. With the help of Yogurt Master Mustafa Dogan, Hamdi spent 18 months perfecting the Chobani recipe. With immediate interest in the product, Hamdi hired four more people, who still work for us today. 

A lot has changed since then. Chobani team is now made up of nearly 3000 innovative, hardworking, fun-loving people. Their newest home in Twin Falls, ID, is the largest yogurt manufacturing facility in the world. Their products are now available throughout the United States as well as in Canada, Australia and the UK. 

But, there are some things that will never change, like their unwavering commitment to producing the best-tasting, highest quality products and being nothing but good to their employees, fans, and local communities.
