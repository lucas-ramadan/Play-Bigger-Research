Launched in 2008 by co-founders Jason Griffith and Ross Goldenberg, SiteCompli provides a unique technology that automatically and continuously aggregates, analyzes and alerts on compliance data such as violations, complaints, permits and inspections from the various New York City government agencies. 

SiteCompli does this in a small fraction of the time that property managers take to do the same task manually. This enables the leading real estate owners, managers, financial institutions and vendors in New York City stay compliance with local laws and save time and money by avoiding unnecessary fines while enabling management staff to focus on solving problems rather than identifying them.
