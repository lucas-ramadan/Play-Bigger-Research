Fusion Coolant Systems provides an advanced coolant and lubrication system for use in manufacturing which increases production rates and tool life.  Today’s metalworking fluids are a toxic mix of oil, water and various chemical additives which provide poor performance at significant costs to worker health, safety and the environment.

Fusion Coolant’s patented CHiP Lube system is the most significant advance in metalworking fluids in many decades.  The system outperforms existing metalworking fluid systems and is proven to reduce costs while simultaneously improving worker health and eliminating a toxic waste stream.
