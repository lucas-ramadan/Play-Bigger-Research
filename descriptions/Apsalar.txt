Apsalar was founded in 2010 by adtech veterans who previously started and built Kefta into a leading online behavioral targeting solution. After Kefta was acquired by Acxiom, the Apsalar management team leveraged their combined 75 years of adtech and analytics experience to launch Apsalar and bring the leading mobile attribution and intelligence platform to market.
