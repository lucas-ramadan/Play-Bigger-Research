Founded in 2010, Visual Revenue, Inc. builds a real-time predictive analytics platform that makes human editors the most powerful force in today’s data-driven newsrooms. This helps media organizations to distinguish their brands. 

The Visual Revenue Platform is the only real-time analytics solution that is designed specifically to enhance the hand of editors in data driven newsrooms. It enables editorial judgment and decision-making to be enhanced (not replaced) by a suite of tools that provide real-time decision support for editors and producers of content. Each feature is specially tailored to reduce the complexity of managing content and increase audience engagement across a publisher’s web properties, while maintaining their distinctive editorial voice.

On March 7, 2013, the company was acquired by Outbrain.
