Founded by experts in machine learning, neuroscience, processor architecture, and chip design, Nervana Systems is bringing unprecedented scale and simplicity to the application of brain-inspired algorithms. Deep learning has emerged as the leading strategy for making sense of a wide variety of data but is very computationally intensive. They are developing a scalable hardware solution to solve these types of problems. By making unsupervised learning dramatically faster and more scalable, customers at all levels can derive meaningful insights from their data, an ability previously available only to companies with massively large computing infrastructures.
