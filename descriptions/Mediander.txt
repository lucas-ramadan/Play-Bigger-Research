At MedianderTM they give you what’s relevant to the topics you’re really curious about. They want to make it easy for you to know more about movies, movements, books, people and ideas in relation to one another because they believe that knowing how topics connect is what helps you understand them better.

They spent years creating a knowledge engine called Connects, which uses intelligently designed algorithms to aggregate information, videos and books around topics. In addition, they wanted a new and exciting way to share the connections they perceived in the world, so they created CultureMaps, Mediander’s premier original content. Each CultureMap provides a unique editorial look at cultural subjects and their often surprising connections.
