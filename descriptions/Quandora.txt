Quandora helps companies foster a community of continuous learning and employee engagement through the simple act of asking questions.

Every workplace has unspoken rules, internal processes, general modes of operating, and technological know-how that is hard to find and track. This proprietary knowledge is difficult to capture, document, and communicate to internal teams.

Quandora enables users to ask questions, share knowledge, and learn on a platform that is accessible to all team members. Our web and mobile-based tool ensures that invaluable information is never lost and that communities are constantly learning and improving.

We provide integrations with popular Enterprise tools: GoogleApps, Yammer, SalesForce, Zendesk, HipChat, and more.
