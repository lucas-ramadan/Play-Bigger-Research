Kryptiq is a healthcare connectivity company that facilitates a first-of-its-kind, open collaborative network for healthcare. This network connects physicians with each other and their patients by giving mobility to vital healthcare data. 

More than 30,000 physicians use products in the Connect IQÂ® suite, as part of this nationwide network. Through its affordable and pragmatic technologies, Kryptiq enables these providers to digitally communicate, share and utilize vital information effectively.  Physicians gain better patient engagement, optimize practice revenue and enhance communication with colleagues, patients and across the healthcare ecosystem.
