Gusto was started in 2011 by best friends Josh, Tomer and Eddie to help every business in the world put people first. In 2015, Gusto expanded our payroll service to all 50 states and opened a new office in Denver. They changed our name from ZenPayroll to Gusto to celebrate our customers' courage and passion. Gusto also added health benefits and compliance to our existing payroll service in order to better serve our customers with one, integrated product.
