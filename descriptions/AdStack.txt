AdStack's technology enables marketers to serve different email content based on when, where, and how a message is opened. This allows for automatic, data driven marketing optimization and greater personalization of marketing emails. 

Because optimization happens when the email is opened, AdStack works with every email service provider, and requires no technical integration.
