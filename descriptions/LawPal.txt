Founded in 2013, LawPal is part deal room, part project manager. It is a cloud-based workspace for planning, executing and tracking a transaction, allowing lawyers and clients centralized access to all documents, communications and notes. Stop asking "who's doing what" or "where is that final document". We help everyone on the team communicate ideas and organize the work to be done, bringing a sense of order and calm back to legal work.
We are based in San Francisco and our initial focus is solos/small firms.
