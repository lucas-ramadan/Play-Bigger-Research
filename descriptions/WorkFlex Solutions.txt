WorkFlex’s solution for intraday management is the industry’s first and only purpose built automation and optimization platform for contact center intraday staffing and performance management processes. BPOs and large service providers benefit from reduced management overhead, improved customer service levels and increased agent satisfaction.

Founded in 2009 and based in Cincinnati, WorkFlex has the only technology today that solves the full intraday workforce management challenge. Our patented solutions deliver near real-time matching of workforce supply with demand as well as on-demand scheduling adjustment. WorkFlex Manager, WorkFlex Alert and WorkForce Scheduler automate virtually all manual intraday performance management issues, including issue analysis and solution identification, agent-supervisor communications and the updating of existing workforce management systems.

By applying real-time supply-chain methodologies to agent staffing, WorkFlex enables organizations to dramatically increase service delivery efficiencies and agent satisfaction, while reducing the dependence on forecast accuracy. Designed to work with (and enhance) existing workforce management (WFM) systems, organizations can realize substantial savings using WorkFlex, in addition to increasing agent performance, reducing staff attrition, improving compliance and increasing workforce administrator productivity (by as much as 500 percent).
