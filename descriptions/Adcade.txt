Adcade’s proprietary multi-screen animation software, Epoch, simplifies the creation of HTML5 advertising while providing a flexible workflow for ad builders and designers similar to Adobe Flash. Epoch comes complete with a first-of-its-kind Adobe Photoshop extension called LightSpeedTM, which offers users the ability to easily convert PSDs to HTML5, including assets, code and interactive functionality.

Un-coupled from a single ad server, Epoch gives digital marketers the option to choose an ad server from Adcade’s existing server integrations and export a .Zip ad bundle with the server’s hosting and reporting specs built-in and ready to publish. This grants Epoch users complete creative flexibility and provides a single creative platform needed to build HTML5 banner ads. Designers and developers can now enjoy creative freedom without worrying whether or not their ads will work across any screen, device, or ad server.
