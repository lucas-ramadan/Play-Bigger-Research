Livongo Health is reinventing the way we manage chronic conditions by blending the power of technology, real-time information and human support to make life easier for people with chronic conditions. And we're starting with diabetes.

Our approach is guided by three simple principles: people with diabetes want to spend less time on their condition; people who treat diabetes want less data and more, better, real-time information so they can help; and payers - including healthcare companies, employers and, increasingly, all of us - want to spend less.
