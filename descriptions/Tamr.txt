Tamr, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was founded in 2013 by database industry veterans Andy Palmer, Mike Stonebraker and Ihab Ilyas with George Beskales, Daniel Bruckner and Alex Pagan.
Following the success of initial research at MIT CSAIL, the Tamr team began building a commercial-grade solution designed to tackle the challenge of connecting and enriching diverse data at scale, quickly and cost effectively.
Launched in the spring of 2014 and backed by a series of investors, such as Google Ventures and New Enterprise Associates, Tamr is deployed in production at a variety organizations, including information services providers, pharmaceutical firms and retailers.
