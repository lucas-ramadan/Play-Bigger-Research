physIQ has developed a personalized physiology analytic platform (PPA) for use in both the regulated healthcare market as well as the unregulated health and fitness market. The technology is designed to detect subtle changes in vital signs and other health indicators to help clinicians manage patients with chronic illness, and to help consumers track their own health and fitness levels. The key differentiator between the physIQ platform and other technologies is that it constructs a personalized baseline norm for each person monitored, rather than simple trending or comparison to population-based statistics. Our technology can also be embedded into patient monitoring devices from other manufacturers who are seeking to design "smarter" products.
