AuthorBee filters social posts from your timeline, organizing them into stories by the TOPICS you really care about. Itâ€™s like a social DVR. You follow your stories, embed them or share and even co-create them with others interested in the same topics, building community around your interests.

Brands use AuthorBee to organize and extend the life of their social assets by creating social "landing pages" filled with engaging social stories - essentially for FREE, by repurposing existing social content.
