Blue River Technology, a pioneer in the use of computer vision and robotics for agriculture. Founded in 2011 by two Stanford University Alumni, Blue River Technology is developing an alternative to chemical-intensive agriculture, which is both expensive and hazardous to the environment. With breakthrough computer vision techniques for identifying weeds and selectively killing unwanted plants, Blue River Technologyâ€™s equipment is significantly more efficient than traditional methods of weed elimination. Its automated solution is particularly well-suited to organic agriculture and for fields with chemical-resistant weeds.
