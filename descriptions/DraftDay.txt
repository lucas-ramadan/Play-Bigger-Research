DraftDay is a daily fantasy sports website offering real money games for NFL, NHL, MLB and NBA games. 

Founded in September 2011, DraftDay gives sports fans a fun and challenging way to test their fantasy sports skills. DraftDay offers daily games with buy-ins ranging from no cost to $500.  Players can participate in head-to-head or multiplayer games and enter numerous games in one day. The players who accumulate the highest amount of points for their fantasy teams can win real money.

The DraftDay team has had previous success building the online video education and software businesses CardRunners and Hold'em Manager. All DraftDay games are legal in the U.S. and Canada, exempt from the 2006 UIGEA, using the same rules as season long fantasy leagues.
