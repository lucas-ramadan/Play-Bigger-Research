Exabeam is a big data security analytics company that provides enterprises with advanced user behavior intelligence to unlock the potential of existing security information and event management (SIEM) and log management data repositories, enabling IT security teams to more quickly detect and respond to cyberattacks and insider threats in real time. The companyâ€™s user behavior intelligence technology fundamentally changes the way cyberattacks are detected and simplifies security operations by focusing on attacker behavior rather than ever-changing malware and tools, shining a spotlight on suspicious network activity and reducing the noise of false positive security alerts. Through extraction and enrichment of log feeds, user session tracking, behavior analysis and event risk scoring, Exabeam gives IT security teams the ability to detect and track credential use in all parts of the attack chain and prioritize responses.

The company was built by seasoned security and enterprise IT veterans from Splunk, Imperva and Sumo Logic, and believes in working together as a team to achieve customer success. To learn more about our corporate culture, visit http://exabeam.com/who-we-are/.
