RocketOn is pioneering the development of parallel virtual worlds. We've built a complete platform for running virtual worlds on top of any website. Our partners can easily layer a virtual world over their existing sites, creating a unique community and space in which their users can meet, play and socialize.

Imagine avatars and virtual objects that appear on top of every site. This is happening right now, and it's a whole new way to browse the Web. Avatars roam from one website to another, socializing, playing games, and interacting with virtual objects. These virtual spaces are being layered over all sorts of sites. Right now, there are avatars running around Google, YouTube, MTV.com, Facebook, personal blogs, and hundreds of other sites.

We're now opening up virtual communities across the Internet, where our partners can sell virtual goods to their users and monetize their traffic. The virtual goods market provides a healthy revenue stream, and we've developed a robust platform for building and monetizing virtual spaces over high-traffic websites.
