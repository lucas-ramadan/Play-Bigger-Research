Raise is a p2p marketplace for buying and selling gift cards online. Launched in February of 2013, the platform allows sellers to earn cash for their unwanted gift cards and gives buyers the opportunity to save at thousands of their favorite brands. Raise is now available on both iOS and Android as an extension of our marketplace that enables you to make your money worth more, on the go.

In the $400 billion prepaid retail market, more than 20% of gift cards and store credit go unused each year. Raise offers a way to reclaim this value and puts purchase power back into the hands of consumers. Raise gives consumers freedom and control over how they spend and save their money.
