Quite simply, we believe that all customers want is a no-frills way to get the cheapest and fastest custom apparel, without sacrificing any quality and service.

Guaranteed Lowest Pricing
When we first set out in the custom apparel industry, we couldn’t understand why there were so many differences in pricing amongst various online retailers and local print shops when vendors are ordering the same blank garments and using the same inks and printing processes. At UltraPress, we keep our costs low through volume, and transfer those savings onto the customer. Every single blank product on UltraPress is labeled with a price, so you know exactly what the differences are between a Gildan and an American Apparel shirt. Each order comes with all-inclusive pricing, and we never hide any additional fees at the end. Best of all, with our Guaranteed Lowest Pricing, if you send us a competitor’s pricing invoice that’s lower than ours, we’ll beat it by 5%.

4 Business Day Shipping Comes Standard
UltraPress has built one of the most extensive printing networks in the United States. Our production facilities are within a one business day ground shipment from any customer in the continental US. We’re now able to deliver your custom apparel in the quickest possible turnaround time without incurring any extra fees, whereas most competitors take up to 2 weeks standard, and then charge an additional 25% for rush. At UltraPress, you can have both the best prices AND the fastest standard turnaround times in the country.

High Quality Customer Service
UltraPress prides itself on delivering the highest quality product with the best customer service, so that customers can order with confidence and have 100% satisfaction with their experience. Due to the human touch of customized goods, mistakes can happen. Our promise is if issues do arise with your order, we will do whatever it takes to resolve the situation fairly.
