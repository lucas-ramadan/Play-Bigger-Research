pioneer and technology leader in rapid, secure and friction-free provisioning of native applications from the cloud through virtualization. Our groundbreaking and patented cloudpaging technology can deliver a native application from the cloud between 20x to 100x faster compared to a linear digital download and execute on the client platform without installation and with a much reduced IT support footprint.

Unlike expensive remoting solutions which cannot scale, cloudpaging does not push pixels from the cloud â€“ the technology actually transmits pre-virtualized native software instructions (a page at a time and on demand) which are then executed on the user's machine in a transient manner and at full performance. As a result, cloudpaged native applications can reduce network usage by up to 95% and can become Web-scale with minimal server footprint.
