Currently, it takes 3-5 days to diagnose Staph. infections however, some strains are aggressively virulent which can lead to a patient's limb amputation or death in under 48 hours. Further, the spread of these aggressive strains cannot be geophysically monitored to track epidemiological trends (bioinformatics).

To solve these problems, BioNanovations is currently developing a handheld, integrated real-time diagnostic platform which decreases the diagnostic time of Staph. infections from 3-5 days to under 30 minutes. By enabling real-time bacterial diagnostics, our platform enables immediate transmission of diagnostic metadata thus creating a new market for real-time bioinformatics.

As our customers, healthcare professionals, hospitals and government agencies will benefit by restoring temporal diagnostic efficiency, providing access to real-time epidemiological trends and, most importantly, reduce patient morbidity and mortality.
