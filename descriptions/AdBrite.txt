adBrite is the largest independent advertising exchange. 

adBrite first started taking advertising for external sites in 2003, and raised $4 million in venture capital from Sequoia in 2004. In 2006, adBrite raised another $8 million from Sequoia and Artis Capital, the same pair that invested together in YouTube.  

In 2008, adBrite changed its business model and became an ad exchange. adBrite maximizes selection and control for advertisers and publishers by providing site-level transparency, display and video capabilities, and an open platform for data providers and real-time bidders.
 
adBrite now reaches more than 160 million U.S. unique visitors each month.
