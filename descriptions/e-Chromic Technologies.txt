e-Chromic Technologies electrochromic thin film turns diffuse reflective when switched on. It is the only smart window technology that is suitable for retrofitting existing windows. Unlike other dynamic window products which are only sold as expensive new window units, their thin film that can be installed on to existing windows from inside a commercial or residential building. According to DOE energy models, their reflective electrochromic thin film is 43% more effective that state of the art absorptive technologies and will be priced at less than 50% of competing smart windows. Use of their product can reduce air conditioning costs and related CO2 emissions by ~35%. It is wireless and user controllable. Their product is transparent when switched off, allowing a maximum amount of light into the building. When switched to fully reflective, it will prevent ~90% of solar heating from entering. It is anticipated that it will have a 3rd mode, which will be visually transparent while rejecting infrared heating.
