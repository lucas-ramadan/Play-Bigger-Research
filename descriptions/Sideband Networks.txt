Sideband is an early tripwire at the point of greatest business risk. Our out-of-band sensors watch all communications related to critical assets, and develop a cognitive model of normal behavior. We build a profile of normal communications, and then transmit highly tuned alerts when assets are in real danger. With Sideband premium red alerts, action can be taken quickly, before information is taken.
