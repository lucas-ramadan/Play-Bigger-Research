XetaWave, based just east of Boulder Colorado, started in 2010 with the goal of developing the most advanced data-centric wireless radios. Our team includes industry veterans as well as experts in other fields that bring advanced concepts that have never been applied to this industry before.

We are continually adding highly skilled employees to our team. Since we do many things from hardware, software, environmental design, signal processing, we are not limited in specific backgrounds or skill sets of our future employees.
