CruiseWise brings wisdom and simplicity to cruise booking. CruiseWise, originally founded in May of 2010 by partners Amit Aharoni, Steve Davis and Nicolas Meunier, launches at a crucial time for the cruise industry; recent reports suggest bookings are down in the wake of the capsizing of the Costa Concordia off the coast of Italy. Carnival Corp., Royal Caribbean International, and Disney cruises have all reported significant dips in cruise booking numbers following the accident. Ordinarily, this time of year is considered to be the high point in terms cruise booking volume. 

CruiseWise provides detailed information about ship sizes, service level, and construction date and offers photos of cabins, and entertainment facilities, all in a layout that manages to remain simple and responsive without being overwhelming.
