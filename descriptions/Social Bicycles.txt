The team at Social Bicycles (SoBi) is passionate about transportation and technology. They believe the world can be improved by increasing personal mobility, and that every community has a right to more sustainable and affordable transportation choices.

These convictions have driven the team us to provide not just any bike share, but the most thoughtful and sophisticated bike share on the market. Social Bicycles designs bike share bicycles, equipment and software. The company offers all of their customers (municipal, institutional, and commercial markets) bike share operations training and technical support. 

SoBi pioneered an innovative “smart bike” approach using an integrated GPS-enabled lock that works with affordable bike racks. This new paradigm is shifting the bike sharing equipment industry, providing more flexible fleet management for operators and richer features for bike share program members while reducing overall operating costs.

The company was founded by Ryan Rzepecki in New York City. As an urban planner and project manager for the New York City Department of Transportation’s bike program, Ryan watched as bike share systems began spread around the globe. He loved the concept but felt that infrastructure costs needed to be reduced in order for bike share to be financially sustainable. He identified one of the core problems, expensive smart-dock infrastructure, and set out to change the industry by using mobile technology to deliver a more affordable and advanced alternative.

SoBi technology continues to improve with advanced features from the tech industry to provide software and hardware that achieves cost reductions and efficiency gains. These unique features have fueled the company’s explosive growth and changed the landscape of the bike share industry.
