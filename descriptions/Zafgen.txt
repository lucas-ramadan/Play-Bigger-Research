Zafgen is the world's first biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing novel obesity therapeutics that directly target and shrink fat tissue to help the body regain and sustain a lean, healthy state. Adipose tissue (fat) is composed primarily of cells that store unused calories for later use. The balance between how the body stores excess calories and later accesses these depots when required plays a critical role in determining the overall size of the fat tissue, and therefore, an individual's weight. Zafgen's groundbreaking approach targets obesity at its biological foundation by safely restoring the balance of fat metabolism, driving the loss of fat and a return to a more healthy body weight. Zafgen's leadership and scientific advisors include the leading experts in obesity, metabolic disorders and medicinal chemistry. Founded in 2005, the company is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
