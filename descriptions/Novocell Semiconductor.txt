Novocell Semiconductor provides antifuse-style one-time programmable (OTP) non-volatile memory (NVM) to the analog and digital fabless semiconductor industry. Based on their Smartbit bit cell technology, their intellectual property product line provides solutions from 8bits to 4Mbits of permanent storage relying on voltage-triggered oxide breakdown rather than stored charge or floating gate designs.
