Postling is a tool that helps small businesses face the daunting task of social media marketing. Brought to you by the founders of Etsy.com, Postling lets users publish content simultaneously to the major social media platforms, including blogs, Twitter, and Facebook.  In addition, users can read and respond to comments left by readers.
 
Small business owners told the Postling team that they would be willing to pay for a social media marketing tool that saves them time and spares them from learning how to navigate yet another website. They listened and created Postling.
