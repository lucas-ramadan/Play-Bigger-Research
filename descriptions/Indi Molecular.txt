Indi Molecular is an emerging life sciences company that is developing a synthetic class of diagnostic and therapeutic agents with antibody-like properties: protein-catalyzed capture agents. PCCs were created in collaboration with the California Institute of Technology using “click chemistry,” a synthetic process that allows scientists to permanently join (“click”) together molecular components with remarkable precision and stability. PCCs offer the promise of improved selectivity, superior binding affinity, fully synthetic composition and a vastly low molecular weight compared to monoclonal antibodies, the current standard for identifying biomarkers in most diagnostics platforms – and in many therapeutic uses.

The company launched as a spinout from its parent company Integrated Diagnostics (Indi) in 2013 with a $1.5 million seed round led by InterWest Partners together with several angel investors.
