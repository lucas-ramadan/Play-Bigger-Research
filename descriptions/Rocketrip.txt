Rocketrip is an innovative corporate travel solution that can save companies 30% or more off existing travel spend. Inspired in part by a platform Google built internally to manage travel, Rocketrip sets real-time budgets and rewards employees for beating them (e.g. by choosing low cost flight/car/hotel options, booking early, etc.). It's a huge money saver and culture builder at the same time.
