MANTA Instruments Inc. (MANTA) is commercializing scientific instruments that use breakthrough technology to characterize nanoparticles much more effectively than existing products. 
 
Existing instruments for characterizing nanoparticles are unable to: i) adequately measure concentration of nanoparticles, ii) measure samples with mixed nanoparticle sizes, and iii) reliably measure changes in nanoparticle size over time.
