Fitbit inspires people to exercise more, eat better and live
healthier lifestyles. 

The company is developing an ultra-compact wireless wearable sensor, called the Fitbit Tracker, that automatically tracks data about a person's activities, such as calories burned, sleep quality, steps and distance.

The Fitbit Tracker collects activity data automatically while it is
worn by the user all day. The collected data is wirelessly uploaded to
a website where the wearer can see their data and track their progress toward personal goals. The website provides a motivational interface where users can share their progress, compare themselves against similar people and work toward virtual goals with their friends, family and
co-workers. At the website, users can also manually log nutrition,
weight and other health information in order to gain a complete
picture of their health.

Fitbit makes it easy to achieve a healthy lifestyle by automating the
collection of health data and providing a motivating and entertaining
user interface.
