The basic reality of disparate, multiple electronic health record (EHR) systems involved in provider communications remains a stumbling block to easily facilitating sharing of key clinical information at the point of care or use. Searching for, aggregating, and consolidating relevant clinical context is the most time-intensive and burdensome activity currently facing physicians and administrative staff. The need for clinical integration, knowledge management, and clinical analytics derives from the massive databases stored by healthcare companies, hospitals, and device companies, most of which are not integrated or synthesized with each other. Using clinical integration, knowledge management, and clinical analytics, IIC intelligently extracts relevant clinical context from content for faster access to the most important patient information needed for clinical decision making, from e-referral, to real-time automated prior authorization, to billing.
