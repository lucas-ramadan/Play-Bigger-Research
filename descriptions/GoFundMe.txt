Founded in 2008, GoFundMe evolved out CreateaFund.com. GoFundMe was formally introduced on May 10, 2010 by California Product Shop, Inc co-founders Brad Damphousse and Andrew Ballester.

GoFundMe is a personal donation website that makes it incredibly easy for people to raise money online for the things that matter to them most. Users can create their online donation website in less than a minute and share it with friends & family using GoFundMe's built-in connections to Facebook, Twitter, and email. 

The service charges an automatic 5% fee on all online donations collected. Donations go directly into a user's PayPal account to ensure instant and secure access to all money collected. For more information please visit the site at GoFundMe.com
