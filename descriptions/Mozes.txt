Mozes Connect enables marketers to do three things:
1) Create a mobile campaign such as voting, contesting, trivia, commerce and sharing fan-generated content on screen.
2) Promote that campaign using text, voice, QR codes, mobile web pages, and social media.
3) Manage and customize those campaigns while analyzing real-time results.

In addition, we provide the strategic services necessary to leverage the power of Mozes.
