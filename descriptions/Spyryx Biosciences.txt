Spyryx Biosciences was formed in 2013 by our scientific founder, Dr. Robert Tarran, based on his discovery of a previously unknown mechanism that the lung uses to regulate fluid on its surface.  This mechanism is dysfunctional in the lungs of CF patients due to genetic mutations and is believed to be the root cause of the progressive dehydration that leads to the unfortunate cycle of mucus accumulation, bacterial colonization, immune response and tissue scarring, loss of lung function, and often early death. 

Spyryx' product leverages the mechanism discovered by Dr. Tarran and has shown promising results in preclinical studies by dramatically increasing survival in an animal model of CF.  Our product's action is independent of the genetic mutations that cause CF, thereby having the potential to provide disease-modifying therapy to the entire CF patient population.

Dr. Tarran's laboratory has also demonstrated a connection between this fluid regulation mechanism and the dehydration seen in COPD patients, who suffer from severe, chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  Spyryx is investigating the application of our product to this devastating disease as well.
