Banyan Biomarkers was founded in 2002 by Ron Hayes, PhD , Kevin Wang, PhD, and Nancy Denslow, PhD to create the first Point of Care (POC) Blood Test to diagnose traumatic brain injury (TBI). Currently no blood test exists for use by physicians to detect the presence and severity of brain trauma. Banyan Biomarkers’ research has identified unique and proprietary biomarkers present in the patient’s blood following injury to the brain. The detection and quantification of these biomarkers may provide early indications of brain trauma essential for earlier intervention and management.
