Arguably one of the first Web 2.0 sites because of its focus on connecting its users, eHarmony, an online relationship website, matches users together using a rigorous 250+ item questionnaire. It is popular and successful with well over 20 million registered users.  On average, 542 people marry every day in the U.S. as a result of being matched on eHarmony, or 4.8% of new marriages (Harris, 2010).  

eHarmony's matching system determines members' compatibility with others based on their values, character, intellect, humor, religious/spiritual beliefs and many other dimensions.  In all, it analyzes 29 dimensions of compatibility and synthesizes matches using an algorithm built on 35 years of clinical research.

Currently, eHarmony operates online matchmaking services in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and Brazil.
