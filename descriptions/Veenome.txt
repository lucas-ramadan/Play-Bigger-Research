Veenome automatically translates videos into data at a very large scale to help Ad Networks and Publishers lift their CPMs through targeting, reduce fraud through viewability detection and eliminate brand safety/objectionable content concerns.

Specifically the data that we create from these videos includes:

IAB Category, IAB Subcategory, Brand Safety Category, Viewability(Player size, player page position, autoplay and muting detection), Duration, Player Size, Media Size, Media Type, Media URL, Page URL and FPS

Which gets used for:

Moderation/brand safety 
Categorization and classification for CPM lift and auditing
Object, product tags for e-commerce
Viewability detection for overall ad value decisioning and publisher evaluation
