GelSight, Inc. provides extremely detailed and rapid surface measurements through the novel GelSight sensor technology. Our approach to metrology is flexible: the same core technology can be used to measure any rigid material at scales spanning four orders of magnitude. Still in its inception, GelSight, Inc. has already designed and manufactured prototypes for clients in aerospace, ballistics and metrology. As GelSight expands, we also look forward to learning more about your surface measurement needs.
