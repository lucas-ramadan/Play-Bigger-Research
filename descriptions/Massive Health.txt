Massive Healthâ€™s vision is to make healthy living attainable for everyone, and better science available to all. Through great design and intuitive technology, Massive Health provides access to the information that makes healthy living a daily habit and readily understandable. 

Their first experiment, the Eatery, helps people eat healthier by making it fun, simple, and engaging to track food and build healthy habits.  Rather than counting calories or journaling each bite, the Eatery equips consumers with an exciting way to document what they eat and get valuable feedback on overall healthiness.

Founded in 2010, Massive Health is led by former Firefox creative lead Aza Raskin, and is funded by top investors.
