Hail, track and pay for cabs by phone. And when you do, get an experienced driver who knows the way, and never pay more during times of high demand. Flywheel adds entire fleets at once, using cars already on the road to meet demand at any time of day or night. And by working with existing fleets, Flywheel can scale supply quickly and predictably while avoiding long, expensive regulatory battles and the pains of inexperienced professional drivers.
