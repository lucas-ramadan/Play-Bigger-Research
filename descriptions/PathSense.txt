They created PathSense to solve a problem that plagued their previous startup â€” Trapster. At Trapster they had over 20,000,000 users and would have loved to offer them background location monitoring and a host of other features that were just impossible at the time due to the GPS battery drain. The PathSense team has spent the past 2-years hard at work on this problem, and they've cracked it - They are very proud and excited to offer their beta SDK!
