FlightCar is the first company to establish a marketplace that allows vehicle owners parking at the airport to rent out their cars to other travelers. Owners get free airport parking, and renters choose from a wider selection of vehicles at lower prices than those offered by the major car rental chains. A similar peer-to-peer car sharing model successfully exists at a local level, where owners rent out their vehicles to neighbors. FlightCar is the first to bring this model to airports in order to serve air travelers. All rentals are insured with a comprehensive $1 million policy that protects both owners and renters.
