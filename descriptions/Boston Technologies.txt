Over the past five years advancements in technology have continued to push the envelope, often taking conventional wisdom by surprise when the impossible becomes reality. During this same time period the popularity of foreign exchange trading has been running a nearly parallel, upward course. The vision of Boston Technologies is to harness the expansion of these two rapidly growing sectors of the economy and take them to the next level.

Boston Technologiesâ€™ innovative bridge technology serves as an excellent example of the fusion of technology on the one hand and foreign exchange on the other. Prior to the availability of a â€œsoftware bridgeâ€ it was challenging for foreign exchange brokerages using MetaTrader â€“a trading platform very popular in the foreign exchange market â€“ to offset risk and manage certain trades. Through the development of provided by Boston Technologiesâ€™ bridge, brokerages now have the ability to employ a wildly popular, riskless trade execution model known as Straight Through Processing (STP). This bridge is simply one of the many software solutions Boston Technologies hopes will redefine the trading industry.
