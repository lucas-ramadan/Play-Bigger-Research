Madison Vaccines Incorporated (MVI) is developing two distinct vaccines for patients with prostate cancer, and a test to identify those patients who will benefit from these vaccines. MVI is a Delaware C-Corporation operating in Madison, Wisconsin whose principal founders are Douglas McNeel, M.D., Ph.D. and Richard Lesniewski, Ph.D. MVI’s lead vaccine, pTVG-HP, is given by a simple intradermal injection, targets a clinically validated target made by prostate tumors known as prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), and is progressing in a Phase 2 human clinical trial in men who are at very high risk of developing bone metastases after having their cancerous prostate glands removed or irradiated. Early biological and biochemical signals of activity were observed in Phase 1. The company’s second DNA vaccine, pTVG-AR, targets the androgen receptor (AR), a critically important molecule driving prostate cancer growth. pTVG-AR is poised to start clinical trials in early 2014. A novel and potentially proprietary signature in the blood of certain men with prostate cancer has been discovered by the McNeel lab that could become the basis of a companion diagnostic test used to predict which men will respond favorably to MVI vaccines.
