In 2004, Centice was founded to commercialize patented and patent-pending computational sensor technology originally developed at Duke University.

Although our technology has multiple applications, Centice has focused on the development of the PASS Rx system, a pharmaceutical verification product. The PASS Rx system improves the verification process for dispensed medications, thereby increasing patient safety, reducing human error and streamlining the pharmaceutical dispensing process.
There unique sensor technologies impact the health care industry by increasing efficiency, optimizing workflow, providing peace of mind to healthcare providers and boosting patient confidence.
