Heyday’s mission is to help people remember the story of their life: the places they go, things they do, and people they’re with – privately, beautifully and effortlessly. Heyday is built around the life, for people to remember life the way they lived it. Heyday is headquartered in San Francisco.

Heyday is an automatic journal. It will automatically keep track of the places people go and the things they see, so they can remember moments big & small. Photos they take are automatically arranged into beautiful collages, which are easily customizable with exclusive layouts and filters. Using Heyday, people can instantly rediscover meaningful moments and memories from years ago. Search the story of their life by time, place, and people.
