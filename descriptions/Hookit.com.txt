Hookit was started by Scott Tilton and RJ Kraus, former athletes who originally founded SponsorHouse in 2001 out of a motorhome. The original mission was simple - connect athletes with sponsors through the 'Internet'. A revolutionary concept at the time, the vision has evolved into a platform for athletes to track their progression, build their personal brand and earn recognition and deals. 

Today, Hookit is a data, ranking and insights platform that provides the most comprehensive and exacting solution to help brands project, evaluate and amplify sponsorship spend. We help identify and eliminate inefficiencies.
 
We are initially focused on a $115B sports segment where twenty-five percent ($29B) of sponsorship and media rights spending doesn’t produce measurable return on investment. Hookit exists to provide brands with actionable insights from data to ensure they don’t make this mistake and capitalize on their investments.
 
Our highly advanced data analysis platform removes the guesswork and instead focuses on the mathematics – real time, usable data and insights. We offer a benchmark (Hookit Score) for athletes to establish their value in the marketplace. Our data helps brands be more effective with their overall sports marketing spend on athletes, teams, leagues and media. With Hookit, the cliché holds true: numbers don’t lie.
 
Our patent-pending algorithms currently aggregate 1B+ data points per month from hundreds of verified sources. There simply is no other source for the level of comprehensive and multi-faceted data analysis that Hookit provides. We currently work with Monster, GoPro, Toyota, IMG, NBC Sports and 100+ other brands and media properties.
