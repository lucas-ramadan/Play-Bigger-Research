Apofore is developing novel therapeutics for Type 2 diabetes based on the naturally occurring protein, Apolipoprotein A-IV (apo A-IV). The company’s approach is based on the discovery by its scientific founder Patrick Tso, PhD, at the University of Cincinnati, of apo A-IV as an important regulator of insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Recombinant apo A-IV, the company’s lead therapeutic is in preclinical development.
