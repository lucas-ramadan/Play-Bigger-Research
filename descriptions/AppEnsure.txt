AppEnsure Ensures  business critical Applications Performance 
AppEnsure delivers an Application Performance Management (APM) solution that works for every Windows or Linux application, irrespective of its source; custom developed or purchased, and irrespective of how it is deployed; physical, virtual, private cloud, or public cloud. We are agnostic to what an App is or does.

AppEnsure automatically identifies the applications, maps their topologies, monitors end-to-end response time and throughput across the entire distributed topology of the application and its supporting infrastructure. 

The solution delivers automated root cause analysis when application service level degrades, with resolution instructions provided in clear English to Operations. AppEnsure is offered as both an on-premise basis for enterprise, and on a SaaS basis for cloud deployments.
