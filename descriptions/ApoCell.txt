ApoCell is a privately held molecular biomarker development, services, and diagnostics company headquartered in Houston. Founded in 2004, the company is a leader in molecular biomarker detection and analysis and applies its expertise in the areas of oncology, diabetes, molecular diagnostics and drug development. The companyâ€™s facilities are CLIA-approved and compliant to applicable FDA regulations. The company has participated in over 120 Phase I, II, and III clinical drug trials for more than 80 sponsor customers. 

ApoCell has patented detection tools and customized platforms to create unique lab-developed tests for biomarker analysis and discovery, focusing on the identification and analysis of multiple biomarkers on isolated rare cells - CTCs, CECs, and circulating stem cells - and the monitoring of pharmacodynamic effects of anticancer drugs. 

ApoCell has recently completed work on the first generation instrument of a new technology for the isolation of viable CTCs from a range of cancer types. Known as ApoStream, the device works by exploiting unique characteristics of tumor cells that distinguish them from healthy blood cells through dielectrophoresis field flow fractionation (DEP-FFF). ApoCell is using the platform in house in ongoing clinical trials, and intends to develop it towards market distribution. The commercialization of ApoStream will enable the early detection of metastases in many cancers, and accelerate the development of personalized cancer treatment
