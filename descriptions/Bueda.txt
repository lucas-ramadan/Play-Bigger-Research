Buedaâ€™s goal is to understand and connect the worldâ€™s information. 

Leveraging research from Carnegie Mellon University, Buedaâ€™s semantic matching engine enables the creation of smarter applications in markets where information overload creates significant barriers to communication efficiency. Buedaâ€™s first product focuses on providing publishers the ability to access the semantic platform via an API. Buedaâ€™s new product, Five, is a semantic-based social lead generator that facilitates meaningful and engaging conversation around a promotional message. Five uses the semantic API to understand the message being promoted and the users on various social networks that would be most receptive. Fiveâ€™s ability to identify the most relevant and influential people increases the reach of the promoted content through a network effect.
