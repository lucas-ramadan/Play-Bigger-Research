Imagine a world in which officials and citizens can easily access government financial data. They chart trends, pull data points, run reports, and see the revenue and expenditures that support the many services that touch our lives and communities. Increased access connects citizens with senior staff and elected leaders. It improves trust and dialogue between cities and citizens. And better tools save time and improve decision-making by putting critical data at the fingertips of key decision-makers.  That world now exists. Applying the latest technologies, we create web applications that visualize, analyze, and share government financial data. Governments of all types and sizes can increase internal productivity and build bridges to their communities. By building a platform that is easy-to-use, affordable, and powerful, we are taking "open data" to new heights.
