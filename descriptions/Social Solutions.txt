Social Solutions has developed a results-oriented software to relate efforts of the social service industry to their evaluation and performance. They called the software "Efforts to Outcomes Software" or ETO SoftwareÂ®. In 2000, Social Solutions was launched to promote the benefits of relating efforts to outcomes to improve the effectiveness of social service delivery. 

Since making ETO Software available, it has been adopted by thousands of human service organizations and government agencies throughout the U.S. and Canada.  Today, Social Solutions not only provides ETO SoftwareÂ®, but also a variety of ETO Sevices to assist organizations in their "ETOlution." Additionally, They engage in a wide array of advocacy efforts intended to build awareness and transform the way in which human services are delivered, funded, and evaluated.
