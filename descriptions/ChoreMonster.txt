ChoreMonster is a platform for web and mobile that makes chores actually fun for kids.

Kids earn points by completing chores to use towards rewards like an hour of video games or a camping trip.  For each chore completed, kids also earn a ticket to the Monster Carnival, where they can earn over 100 collectible, interactive monsters.  With ChoreMonster, kids will beg to do their chores!

In April 2014, ChoreMonster launched ChoreMonster 2.0, adding support for iPad, 4 new languages, integration with Amazon.com for rewards, and more.  ChoreMonster also removed subscriptions, making the app entirely free for all households.
