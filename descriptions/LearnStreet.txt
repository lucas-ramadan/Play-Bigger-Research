LearnStreet is an early-stage startup focused on changing the way people of all backgrounds and skill levels learn how to code.
We are a small, passionate team of product craftsmen, hackers and designers doing what we love—building a service that inspires users to tap into their amazing potential. We believe putting the power of coding in more hands can unleash a wave of creativity that makes the world a better place for all of us. We’re proud to have already received some kind words from the folks at LAUNCHedu.

The LearnStreet team is based in San Francisco, California and backed by Khosla Ventures.
