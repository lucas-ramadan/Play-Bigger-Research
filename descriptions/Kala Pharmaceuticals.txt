Kala Pharmaceuticals is developing novel treatments for diseases that affect mucosal tissues. The company's proprietary mucus penetrating particle technology dramatically improves drug distribution and pharmacokinetics by uniformly coating the mucosal surface with biocompatible, drug-loaded particles. Kala's formulations achieve high, sustained local drug concentrations with reduced systemic exposure and are delivered in a patient friendly format. The company's research efforts have demonstrated successful in vivo proof-of-concept in mucosal organs such as the respiratory tract, eye, and cervicovaginal tract, enabling diverse product opportunities that target significant clinical unmet need. Kala is focused on advancing an internal pipeline of products through human proof-of-concept, while establishing R&D collaborations with select partners to improve products in their pipelines.
