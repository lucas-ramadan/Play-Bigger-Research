ShowKit provides companies and developers tools to build real-time customer service support services designed for mobile users. ShowKit's patent-pending solution includes an SDK, which is integrated into a company's mobile app to enable in-app screen sharing, co-navigation, and video chat. A company's support agents can field customers' calls from inside a web-based CRM application or from a smartphone or tablet, and can remotely view and navigate the customers' mobile screen.
