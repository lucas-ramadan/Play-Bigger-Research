SuVolta, Inc. develops and licenses CMOS semiconductor technologies that significantly reduce the power consumption of integrated circuits (ICs).  Excessive power consumption is generally regarded as the biggest challenge in semiconductors today, affecting all product categories – from high-performance servers to mobile phones to portable consumer electronics.  The PowerShrink™ platform enables semiconductor companies to cut chip power in half without sacrificing performance, losing functionality, or having to migrate to more advanced – and costly – semiconductor process node.
