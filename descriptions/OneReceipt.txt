OneReceipt is a faster and simpler way for people to organize their receipts and analyze their spending habits. OneReceipt works directly with Gmail / Google Apps to automatically understand e-receipts. Registration is quick and accounts get synced automatically. For paper receipts, users need to take a picture with their phone and email it to their personal @onereceipt.com address. This data is presented to the user through an easily navigated interface. OneReceipt also provides tools like monthly spending reports and return alerts. The service acts as a post-purchase hub for consumers.
