Neuraltus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a privately held biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing high-impact therapeutics that address critical unmet needs, primarily in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Neuraltus has three clinical-stage programs in its development pipeline, including potential treatments for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease), Parkinson's disease and dyskinesias associated with the treatment of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Multiple Sclerosis, as well as lysosomal storage disorders such as Fabry's disease and Gaucher's disease. Each of Neuraltus' clinical-stage programs is advancing novel drug molecules that represent new, first-in-class approaches to treating the Company's target disease indications.
