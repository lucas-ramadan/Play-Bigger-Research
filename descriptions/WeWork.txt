WeWork is a platform for creators. We provide the space, community and services you need to create your life’s work. Founded in 2010 by Adam Neumann and Miguel McKelvey in New York, we are now home to more than 40,000 members in 23 cities across the globe.

We are helping to create a world where people work to make a life, not just a living. There has been a macro shift towards a new way of work—one focused on a movement towards meaning. WeWork is accelerating this movement.
