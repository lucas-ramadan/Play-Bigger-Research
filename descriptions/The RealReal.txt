We make luxury consignment easy with free white glove pick-up in 16 U.S. cities, or free shipping via FedEx. Free pack and ship services are also available at no charge through FedEx Office Retail Centers. Consignors receive 60% of the sale price to start, and elevate to 70% when they reach $7,500 in annual sales. All items received are thoroughly inspected and authenticated by our team, and then curated into daily sales. Consignors track their sales from a personal online dashboard.
