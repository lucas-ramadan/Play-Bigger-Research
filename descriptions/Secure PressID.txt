They are throwing off the yoke of weak meaningless identities (passwords), but they are not falling for the unfriendly strong identity solutions (tokens) either. Their revolution is a revolution of the people, and the people demand strong identity support that is fast, reliable, and most of all easy to use. Above all people donâ€™t want to be forced to buy another gizmo or widget.
