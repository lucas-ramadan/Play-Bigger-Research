We are enabling small fashion boutiques to aggregate products and sell in the social media space.

Consumers can find, follow & shop their favorite boutiques in their favorite cities, on the go!

Today, online sales are nearing 50% of all U.S. retail sales, and being trendy is a rapidly growing trend!
Online clothing sales account for over 25% of all online sales, with a trending 95% growth year-on-year.  

However, these figures are in the traditional e-commerce space.  And, we're interested in the future of making a sale...SOCIAL COMMERCE.  Selling right in the social space, and it's just beginning to take off!

74% of consumers rely on social networks to guide their purchase decisions, and the switch to s-commerce is due to a few key variables:

- more time spent on social networks
- brands getting outside of fan pages and targeting consumers in their direct news feeds
- technology advances such as geo-location

So what does all this have to do with small fashion boutiques?

THE PROBLEM: 

Small fashion boutiques are a major market niche across the map & the majority are not selling online or manage a one-dimensional online presence.  The very few that have tapped in to selling limited quantities in the social space manage a time-consuming and manual selling system via facebook.  

WHY are boutiques not online?

- Limited inventory and budgets for an e-commerce site
- Limited resources to effectively implement and manage a social commerce selling system

We are catapulting small fashion boutiques to sell in the social space with an easy and efficient platform!
