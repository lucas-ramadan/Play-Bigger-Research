Priceonomics is the price guide for everything.

Price guides are helpful for buying and selling used things. How much should I spend on this used bicycle on Craigslist? How much should I sell my stereo system for on eBay? Is this used Vespa a good deal, or what?

Hate getting ripped off or over-paying for stuff? At Priceonomics, we build price estimates so you can buy or sell with confidence. We research past transactions on the web to determine how much people have sold their items for. By looking at the price on past transactions, we build great estimates to help you get the most value for the best price.

Today, we provide price estimates for used bicycles, motorcycles, cars and boats. Soon we're expanding to TVs, computers, electronics, phones, baby strollers, and anything you might want to buy or sell on Craigslist, eBay, or in the real world, but have no idea how much it's worth.
