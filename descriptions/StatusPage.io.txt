StatusPage.io launched in 2013 to give companies a better way to be more transparent with their customers. They are focused on serving companies who provide tools to build products for consumers. They recognize managing a status page outside of ones own infrastructure can be a hassle, and hope to increase the transparency of the web by making it easier to do so.
