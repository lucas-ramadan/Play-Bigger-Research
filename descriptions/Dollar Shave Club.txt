Founded by Mark Levine and Michael Dubin in July 2011, DollarShaveClub.com is a leading provider of quality razors to its members. Dollar Shave Club is a monthly membership service that delivers fresh, stainless steel razor blades and other personal grooming products to customers by mail. Home delivery, rather than purchasing through conventional retail stores is an added convenience for customers. Dollar Shave Club is dedicated to providing their customers a high-quality product while saving money.

Available razor subscriptions include:
* The Humble Twin: a standard two-blade razor ($1/month, plus s+h)
* The 4x: a four-blade razor perfect for men’s or women’s hair removal needs ($6/month, shipping included)
* The Executive: a state-of-the-art six-blade razor ($9/month, shipping included)

In 2012, Dollar Shave Club launched the campaign video “Our Blades Are F***ing Great,” that introduced the company. As the video went viral, orders reached 12,000 in the first two days. Dollar Shave Club’s viral video received an award from Adage, for “Best Out-of-Nowhere Video Campaign,” and a Webby Award for best Fashion & Beauty website.

With half a million members, Dollar Shave Club launched two new products in 2013, as part of their goal to help customers make smarter choices in their grooming routine. Dr. Carver’s Easy Shave Butter to accompany the razors and One Wipe Charlies, a disposable butt wipe for men. In 2014, the company expanded their product line to include Dr. Carver’s Magnanimous Post Shave Moisturizer: the ultimate amnesty after the disruptive act of shaving.

Involved with several charity organizations and fundraising efforts, Dollar Shave Club has worked with the Colon Cancer Alliance to raise funds for cancer research.
