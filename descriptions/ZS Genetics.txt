Our radically different technology enables detailed images of individual DNA molecules. With this break through it will be possible to directly read genetic information â€” hundreds of times faster, with extreme accuracy, even from small samples.

The ZSG sequencing technology approach provides advantages that are critical to the needs of researchers to drive the next round of discovery: single molecule data and very long molecule (long read) capabilities.
