Credit Karma is re-engineering one of the largest industries in the world – consumer finance. We believe it is a fundamental right that all consumers should have free and comprehensive access to their credit and financial data, and the context, resources and information they need to easily take control of their financial health. Our completely free service begins with credit scores and full credit reports from two major bureaus and brings new levels of transparency and certainty to consumer credit and finance.

Credit Karma users can pull their credit scores and full credit reports from two major credit bureaus for free, with information updated on a weekly basis. Based on an individual user’s credit profile, Credit Karma provides tailored financial product recommendations, including credit cards and personal, home and automotive loans.
