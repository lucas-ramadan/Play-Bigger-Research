Asseta is the most transparent platform ever for buying, selling, and managing equipment.

You no longer have to rely upon disjointed spreadsheets to track your organization's equipment assets. Asseta knows where all of your assets are - locally and globally - regardless of whether they are installed at a production location or buried deep in a warehouse.

Uploading your company's equipment to Asseta is as easy as dragging and dropping files. If your company still needs help uploading to Asseta, we offer free professional asset auditing to customers. Simply apply below, and depending on your location and status of the assets, we will assign an Asseta professional auditor.
