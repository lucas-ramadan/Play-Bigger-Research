Indiewalls helps hotels in development/renovation source artwork for their property from local, independent artists. Wherever the hotel is opening, Indiewalls works with artists in that city to build an art package for the hotel - from large scale originals and installations, to framed prints and photographs for guest rooms.

Indiewalls works hand in hand with interior designers to oversee the curation, printing, framing, and installation of the property's art package.

Buying artwork from local artists lets the hotel support the careers of local artists, while also adding a local component to the hotel.

The artwork in the hotel is cataloged on Indiewalls.com, where guests can browse the hotel's art collection, read the artists' biographies, and buy limited edition prints of artwork in the hotel. 

Since its launch, Indiewalls has curated over 50 spaces in New York City, with artwork from over 180 top independent emerging and mid-career artists.
