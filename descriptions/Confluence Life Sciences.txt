CLS is a drug discovery company focusing on rational drug design to discover and develop mechanistically novel kinase inhibitors for use in both human and animal health care.  CLS’s kinase inhibitors target key signal transduction enzymes involved in the regulation of cancer growth and survival, or in the modulation of chronic inflammation.  Unlike many other kinase inhibitor programs, however, CLS is targeting novel binding sites (on kinase targets that have proved challenging) as well as previously “un-drugged” kinases.  Driving CLS success in this effort is a team of world-class experts with extensive Pharma experience in kinase inhibitor discovery and development.  CLS provides this team with the opportunity to pursue strategies and targets outside Pharma’s traditional focus.  In addition, scientific and business collaborations are being established to enable the success of the business.  The strategy is to develop and maintain a program pipeline: discover, develop, partner, repeat.
