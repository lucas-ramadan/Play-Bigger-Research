eTect’s wireless in vivo communications platform empowers connected medicine. Our flagship product, ID-Cap, provides real-time information to the patients, caregivers, and others in the healthcare ecosystem.

The average cost to develop a new drug averages $802M, of which the clinical trial phase may consume up to half. The cost per participant in a clinical trial can amount to tens of thousands of dollars and estimates indicate more than 8 million people participated in over 20,000 clinical drug trials in 2009.

Clinical trials are the fundamental evaluation of safety and efficacy for a new drug. However, no one knows how many participants in clinical trials took their medications as prescribed. eTect has a solution: the ID-Cap. The ID-Cap includes a capsule with an embedded, ingestible wireless sensor and a wrist watch style reader. Each dose of medication is placed into an ID-Cap capsule, which emits a low power digital wireless message to the wrist watch after ingestion. The digital wireless message is then forwarded through the mobile web to the patient’s personal adherence record. Adherence information can be used by patients, healthcare providers, payers and clinical trial sponsors to monitor and improve medication compliance.
