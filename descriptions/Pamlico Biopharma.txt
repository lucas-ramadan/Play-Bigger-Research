Pamlico BioPharma, Inc. develops fully-human monoclonal antibodies (hmAb) for the rapid diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases and cancer. Pamlicoâ€™s lead program is focused on severe pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN), and is in preclinical IND-directed activities for a mAb cocktail and a companion point-of-care (POC) diagnostic against three serotypes that account for over 40% of SPN infections. Pamlico was founded on technologies from the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF) and from Emory University, and is anticipated to enter clinical trials in late 2015.
