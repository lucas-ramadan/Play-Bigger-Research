Revelytix provides enterprise solutions for integrating data across disparate data sources - without creating new data warehouses or data marts.  

Revelytix has successfully implemented large, data integration projects by virtualizing disparate data sources - regardless of the underlying data schemas or database architecture.  Based on the W3C semantic data standards (RDF, OWL, SPARQL & RIF), Revelytix provides customers with an entirely new approach to an age-old question ; "How can we provide better management analytics without tearing down our distributed data management systems?".  

Knoodl.com enables people across the organization to work together creating descriptions or "ontologies" representing their business processes, applications, and data elements.  Available on the web since 2007, knoodl.com has established itself as the web's most widely tool for developing ontologies.  

The Revelytix software suite includes SPYDER, SPINNER, and REX. SPYDERs are deployed for all targeted data stores, exposing the underlying data as SPARQL end points.  SPINNER is a query processor and optimizer.  REX is a rules engine, based on RIF (Rules Interchange Format) providing the ability to verify processes and data as required by internal policies or  regulatory authorities.

Revelytix allows firms to leverage their existing data warehouses, data marts, and business intelligence tools by adding a semantic-based query engine to your existing  analytical fabric.
