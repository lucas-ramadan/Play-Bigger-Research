Since opening our doors in 1992, we’ve partnered with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, the World Health Organization, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as well as provided pharmacology consulting and pharmacometric analyses for more than 100 drugs. But there’s a lot more to us than protocol design and gap analyses. On top of our vast expertise and relentless attention to detail, we also have very charming personalities. Just ask anyone – or better yet, find out for yourself.
