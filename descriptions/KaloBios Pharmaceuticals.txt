KaloBios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a U.S. based, private monoclonal company, uses its biologic capabilities and its proprietary platform technology to develop first-in-class human antibody therapeutics. The company has multiple programs that were in seven Phase 1 or 2 clinical trials in 2008: KB001 is an anti-infective for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections being tested in cystic fibrosis and in intensive care patients on a ventilator, and KB002 and KB003 are being evaluated in inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. KB004 is in preclinical development for oncology, and the company plans to file an IND for it in 1H 2010. The company's Humaneeringâ¢ technology offers advantages over other methods of human antibody creation in terms of immunogenicity, potency, and manufacturing yields. The company is focusing on partnering its clinical-stage programs in 2009 and may grant limited access to its Humaneeringâ¢ technology platform to select partners.
