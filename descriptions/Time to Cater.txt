Time To Cater is a web-based platform that helps companies and individuals coordinate their ideal catered even at NO EXTRA COST to client.

If you have had to coordinate catering for events or if you need food ordered quickly online, and especially if you have done it consistently, you understand that valuable time is wasted calling potential caterers for availability, prices, and delivery details, etc.

We fix this problem by providing a web-based platform and mobile app that helps companies and individuals coordinate their ideal catered event.

Our client only has to submit their event details and budget to our web application and then show up for the event and enjoy! We take care of EVERYTHING in between.   

And the BEST part is that there is NO EXTRA COST to our client for our service!  We make money by making a commission from the caterers in our Preferred Caterer Network.
