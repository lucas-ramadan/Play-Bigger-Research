FatTail's founders come from the financial industry where they honed their expertise building financial models and services that reduce operational risk and optimize performance. When they took at look at the online advertising industry, they realized that a book of advertising assets is very similar to a book of financial assets, and that many of the methods pioneered in the financial industry would benefit online publishers and advertisers.

FatTail makes it easy for online publishers to price, plan and sell premium guaranteed inventory. With FatTail's sales optimization software, publishers can maximize revenue and save time and resources by automating proposal building, inventory and availability forecasting, and other sales processes. FatTail helps publishers process more transactions faster, get from quote to cash more quickly, and dramatically reduce their reliance on ad networks.

Founded in 2001, the company's AdBook sales and ad operations optimization software for digital advertising is used by more than 500 of the world’s leading websites. PageGage, the company's new online ad sales optimization software helps online publishers increase ad revenues by selling more inventory direct and relying less on ad networks. The company's Ad Operation Services are designed to provide complete ad traffic services on an à la carte or end-to-end basis to both smaller publishers that want to launch their own direct sales programs and large media conglomerates looking to cut operations costs.
