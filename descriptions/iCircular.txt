Circular is broadening the audience for the already powerful preprint business by allowing newspaper advertisers to tap into the rapidly expanding audience of mobile users. This is a natural progression for the insert business, as studies indicate that mobile phones will overtake PCs as the dominant web access device over the next few years!

Youâ€™ve always relied on your Sunday newspaper ads for great deals and savings. Now you can have the best of both worlds - look at your inserts at home, then take them with you on your mobile phone! With iCircular consumers can browse retailer store ads, view product information, make a shopping list, get directions to the closest store, and much more! iCircular is owned/operated by Wanderful Media, headquartered in Los Gatos, California.
