Pongr is a mobile photo marketing and technology company that develops image recognition, artificial intelligence and direct response advertising tools for companies of all sizes to monetize their customer-shared photos on social networks. Brands use the Pongr platform to automate and manage direct-response programs, loyalty and social campaigns, multi-channel promotions and shopper marketing initiatives.

Pongr's image recognition technology is used by brands such as Pepsi, Frito-Lay, Arby's, Nestle and 7-Eleven to make logos and product packaging interactive with mobile phone cameras. The Pongr system processes customer-submitted photos as the entries in contests, sweepstakes and promotions, and also ties photo sharing on social networks to brand loyalty programs. Pongr is an alternative technology to QR codes or bar codes.

Pongr's capabilities can be seamlessly white labeled and fully integrated into existing CRM systems. Our products build on consumer photo-taking behavior inside of Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Foursquare, Tumblr, and other sites to create opportunities to push authentic brand content through advocates.
