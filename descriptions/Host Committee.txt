Host Committee is a venture-funded Internet startup pioneering the collective-buying experience. It initially began in nightlife but has since expanded to sporting events, concerts and cultural shows. The model of the company relies on groups, the more the group grows, the better the experience becomes for all who attend -- typically through experiential perks. 

The company works with individuals but also has a BtoB model with non profits, startups and other companies to help plan experiential events. For nonprofits, Host Committee has helped raise over $1M. 

Host Committee is a part of Trigger Media, a digital media-focused venture incubator. Our team and advisors have been lead or early investors in some of the most exciting tech and media start-ups to come out of Manhattanâ€™s Silicon Alley and the digital media world in recent years, including Daily Candy, Thrillist, Tasting Table, and Zynga.
