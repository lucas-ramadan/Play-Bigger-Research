Portfolium solves the LinkedIn problem for students with no professional work history.  It's an e-portfolio network for students of all majors to visually showcase their skills, projects and experiences to employers.

They believe that motivated, well-accomplished students should frame more than their diploma.  An interactive portfolio of a student's work serves as a powerful measure of their true potential while providing employers and recruiters with a deeper look at candidates for employment opportunities.

Portfolium connects students, along with their portfolios, with the recruiters seeking their specific talents; effectively streamlining the recruiting and transition process from academic to professional life.
