Enpirion manufactures a growing line of Switch-mode DC-DC converters with integrated inductor, which sets their products apart from the competition. The layout and placement of the inductor is one of the most common reasons for power IC related failures and Enpirion solves this problem and reduces foot print, part count, and noise associated with switch-mode power conversion. Applications include high volume consumer products such as mobile phones, portable game players, MP3, and personal media players, as well as data networking, telecoms, user terminal equipment, and notebook/desktop PCs.
