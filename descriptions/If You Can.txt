Based in San Mateo, CA, If You Can Company is developing an educational adventure game for children. Founded by Trip Hawkins (founder of Electronic Arts), Stewart Bonn (18th employee at EA), and Ben Geliher (formerly of Mind Candy, creators of Moshi Monsters), the company’s development studio is located in Tech City in London. 

If You Can develops gamification around school curriculum. Our mission at If You Can is to support and empower children and parents to value and understand themselves and others. By doing so, we believe we can build a better world: for today and for our children tomorrow. We believe that by learning how to persevere through challenge, to feel and show empathy and to make responsible decisions, all of us can be better friends, learners, parents, mentors and citizens.

We believe there is a crisis caused by young children tormented by peers who don’t have these skills. We believe that adults making decisions that destroy our planet and put tomorrow’s children in peril because they don’t have these skills is also a crisis. We believe these crises can be solved – one child at a time, one adult at a time – through working to build Social and Emotional Learning skills in ourselves and others.
