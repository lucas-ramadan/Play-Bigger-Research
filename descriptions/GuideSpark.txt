The web is dramatically changing how users get, find, and consume information â€“ from YouTube videos, blogs and Twitter feeds to social networks and online applications. These recent information trends are becoming an everyday experience, and that experience is carrying over to the corporate world where employees are beginning to expect the same types of information experiences to engage and educate them. HR organizations - who are responsible for most employee training and communications - are not prepared to keep up with these accelerating communication and training trends.

GuideSpark was started to leverage the latest web trends and technologies - like cloud services, web services, online video and more - to help HR organizations deliver HR communications and training solutions that meet the needs of today's employee. GuideSpark brings together decades of experience in financial and benefits education, rich eLearning and Software-as-a-Service applications to build the next generation of HR communications and training solutions.

In a short period of time, GuideSpark is already helping a wide range of companies from small non-profits to large Fortune 1000 Best-Places-to-Work companies. In addition, GuideSpark customers come from many different industries, including software, social networking, legal, health services, not-for-profit, construction, and semiconductors, but they all have one thing in common: they need to take their HR communication and training to the next level.
