DailyCandy, a free daily e-mail newsletter and website, is an insider's guide to what's hot, new, and undiscovered — from fashion and style to gadgets and travel. It is like getting an e-mail from your clever, unpredictable, and totally in-the-know best friend. The one who knows about secret beauty treatments, must-have jeans, hot new restaurants — and always shares the scoop.
