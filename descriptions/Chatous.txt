Chatous is a “social discovery platform through conversation.” The site uses a data-driven approach and algorithm to predict which users will be compatible for conversation, and learns about users as they engage in more conversations. Founded by three Stanford Computer Science students, Chatous grew out of a project the team worked on in CS224W: Social and Information Network Analysis.
