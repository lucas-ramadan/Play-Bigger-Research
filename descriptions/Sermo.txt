SERMO is the leading social network for physicians - the virtual doctors’ lounge and the home of medical crowdsourcing - where doctors anonymously share their true feelings about their profession and lives and talk ‘real world’ medicine.

 SERMO has nearly 500,000 fully verified and licensed members and is now available for doctors in seven countries: the US, UK, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Ireland, Mexico, Spain and New Zealand. 

Founded in 2005, SERMO's mission is to unite physicians and provide them with a safe, private and trusted platform for free and open discussions. SERMO harnesses the collective wisdom of doctors, enabling medical crowdsourcing, knowledge sharing and thus the advancement of medicine.

SERMO is free to practicing physicians. Revenue is generated as healthcare institutions, financial services firms and government agencies purchase SERMO products to access this elite group of practitioners.
