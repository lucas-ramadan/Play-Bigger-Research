Masterson Industries is a new venture focused on the development and production of specialty materials. We’ve built a significant Intellectual Property portfolio and recently moved into a new production facility. Our products enable new capabilities for a broad range of industries that include defense, medical devices, electronics, and telecommunications. Most recently we’ve added sales and marketing expertise in each of the targeted industries. Transition from initial concept to a complete team poised for commercial expansion is complete. Preparation for the commercialization demonstration is underway.
