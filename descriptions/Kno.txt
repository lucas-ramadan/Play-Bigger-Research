Kno, Inc. is an education software company on a mission to "Change The Way Students Learn." We believe engagement is a leading indicator of learning success and grades are a lagging indicator. So we have partnered with over 80 leading publishers to offer more than 200,000 interactive titles that make learning more engaging, efficient, and social for students. They are the same books, only smarter. Each Kno eTextbook is packed with interactive features, assessments, and social sharing tools to engage students at the point of learning. And the Kno platform provides administrators and teachers with the tools they need to easily assign, manage, and monitor their digital learning content and assessments at an enterprise level. 

As part of Kno's commitment to "Do Well, Do Good,"  Kno has created the Kno for Good program, a partnership with DonorsChoose.org, to provide $1 for every purchase made through Kno towards a classroom in need.

Founded in 2009, Kno, Inc. has emerged as a leader in education software. Kno, Inc. has received funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Intel Capital, Goldman Sachs, FLOODGATE and GSV Capital, and is based in Santa Clara, California.
