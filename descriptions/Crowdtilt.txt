Tilt. com is a free and simple way for individuals to collect money with a group, while enterprise tools like Tilt/Open allow businesses to host, brand, and customize their own crowdfunding experience.

We all love doing things as a group. Like most experiences, it's not what you do – it's the people you do it with that really matters. So at Tilt, we’re excited to be building software that makes pooling resources with a group just a little bit easier. Since 2012, over 300,000 groups have used Tilt to turn their ideas, large and small, into reality. Our users have done a lot to make us proud, from thousands of tailgates, fantasy football leagues, and party buses, all the way to sending the Jamaican Bobsled Team to the Sochi Olympics, fundraising the construction of an entire elementary school in India, and bringing the Foo Fighters to perform in their home town.

Tilt - make something happen!
