Vobi provides instant collaboration video/voice/messaging/document and screen sharing across iOS/Android/Web/Windows/Mac. Vobi leverages the power of the network to deliver rich content based on the context of the conversation (who is calling whom, their location, their communication history). Network and call events can automatically trigger collaboration sessions pre- populated with content relevant for the conversation. Based in Austin, Texas, Vobi is backed by VC investor Trailblazer Capital.
