Protochips, Inc. is a rapidly growing early-stage company focused on providing the world's leading materials and life sciences research breakthrough analytical tools for targeted research and development of nano-scale materials. A fundamental problem exists today in that the tools used to observe and the tools used to work with nano-scale materials are separate and independent. A strong market need exists to combine these tools into an integrated platform. Using its own proprietary technology, Protochips is addressing this compelling market need by transforming the most widely used tools in nanotechnology â€“ electron and optical microscopes - from cameras into complete nano-scale laboratories. Our core competency is in the application of semiconductor techniques to the development of MEMS devices capable of providing heat, electrical, liquid and gas environments to samples in situ. Our products enable the study of materials for the life and materials sciences in ways currently not possible, and will ultimately provide the solution for the development and commercialization of revolutionary new nano-scale materials.
