In 2005, devastating worldwide events such as the London bombings and Hurricane Katrina proved that legacy data analysis tools and techniques which used dated, static location information were no longer an effective means for data sharing, risk mitigation or real-time analysis.  To answer this need, we created GeoIQ, the first completely web-based location analysis platform with the capability to unleash a world of dynamic location information that had previously been locked in proprietary databases. The first version of the GeoIQ platform was launched through our community site, GeoCommons, which has since been adopted by more than 20,000 users around the world. 
 
GeoIQ enables enterprises, marketers, retailers and public sector organizations to fuse together massive amounts of information from numerous data sources, analyze it using location as the common pivot point and clearly identify trends and opportunities to drive better business decisions.  Organizations across all market sectors have leveraged GeoIQ's innovative location-based solutions to better deliver actionable information for dynamic decision making.
