Bright Network is an online careers community designed to connect the brightest graduates and undergraduates with the most dynamic employers in the market.

Bright Network released its networking site for intelligent students and graduates with a series of soft launches to a select number of UK university students in 2010.  The site has a minimum academic requirement of ABB (or equivalent) A Level - anybody who meets that is welcome to apply to join the network. 

Once accepted onto Bright Network, members can use the site's intuitive technology to personalise their job search and ensure that the opportunities, events and people they are most interested in are delivered to them.  There is also a variety of relevant rich media content available to help keep them informed of the latest graduate recruitment news and advice.

Bright Network's philosophy is that so many graduates are intelligent (and have the impressive qualifications to prove it!), but each is different and, especially in a Web 2.0 age, deserves to be given the information they need about the things they want to know about.  Bright Network's aim is to use the developing platform of social media to create a new means of personal interaction between companies and their prospective employees.
