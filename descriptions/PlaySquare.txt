PlaySquare™ is Touchable Television™ – a totally new iPad experience for children where they become part of the storyworld with the touch of a finger!

PlaySquare was formed by a team of Emmy award winning children’s media and technology veterans who have combined their efforts to develop the next generation of children's media: "touchable television". Touchable television seamlessly combines existing television episodes with interactive content to allow a child to step into and participate in the story-world of a television property. Playsquare is developing a branded app-based "network" for the iPad, analogous to a television network for 21st century media, that allows for the distribution of interactive media while providing a highly customized, one-on-one relationship with both the parent and child.
