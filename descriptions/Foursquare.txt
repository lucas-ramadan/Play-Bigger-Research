Foursquare is a technology company that uses location intelligence to build meaningful consumer experiences and business solutions. We have two mobile apps: Foursquare and Swarm, and a suite of enterprise and advertising tools.

For consumers, we believe the world is full of amazing experiences. We make two apps to help guide you to them: Foursquare and Swarm.

The Foursquare app helps you discover new places, with recommendations from a community you trust. Find a better experience, anywhere in the world.

In 2009, Foursquare introduced checking in and real-time location sharing with friends. Five years later, we decided to give the check-in its own app. Swarm turns the world into a game: earn coins, collect stickers, and compete with people you know.

For brands, Foursquare provides advertisers ways to connect with audiences that love the things they offer, in the real world. Pinpoint optimizes ad analytics, targeting and measurement, and is the only programmatic platform that has the first-party location data to ensure accuracy and quality.

For developers and enterprises, Foursquare offers hosted technology and data to build context-smart, location-aware apps, and nearly 100,000 developers rely on Foursquare tech, including Apple, Twitter, Pinterest, Yahoo!, Microsoft, and others. For enterprises and analysts, Foursquare offers our Place Insights product, which informs business decisions with the worldâ€™s largest dynamic panel of global foot traffic data.
