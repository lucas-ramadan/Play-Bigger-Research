Takeoff is a filmmaker and software developer who decided to do some video production. During projects we struggled to get accurate feedback during post production. So production took longer, we did extra rounds of edits, and their clients were frustrated. They tried email, ftp, YouTube, Vimeo, and some other professional tools. They were either insufficient, too complex, or too expensive.
