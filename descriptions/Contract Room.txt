ContractRoom is the first cloud-based platform to streamline enterprise collaboration for buyers and suppliers, while also bridging gaps in the current contracting process. Moreover, it leverages structured data never before captured in B2B/B2G transactions.

For any high volume, high frequency contracting processes, ContractRoom can complement (or replace) current, siloed solutions such as eSignature and Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM), which only address pieces of the overall process. As an end-to-end solution for critical document-intensive processes, ContractRoom is associated with the evolving software category called Digital Transaction Management (DTM). Researchers estimate that by YE2016 70% of large enterprises will have a DTM initiated or fully implemented.

ContactRoom customers are experiencing significant improvements in efficiency and productivity – 100% more control, 75% faster and 50% more accurate, and 20% less expense. Many of our Fortune 1000 customers initially implement ContractRoom within their Procurement & Legal departments so as to streamline the RFP-to-Contract process, but also to leverage the platform’s vendor optimization capability.
