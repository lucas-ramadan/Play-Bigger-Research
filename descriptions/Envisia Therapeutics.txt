As many as 285 million people suffer from disease-related visual impairments and blindness1, but an estimated 80 percent of these visual impairments are actually preventable2. Unfortunately, the safety and effectiveness of many medical therapies for ocular disorders are limited due to poor drug uptake, non-specificity to target tissues, systemic side effects, or poor adherence to therapy. With a rapidly aging population, the unmet medical needs in ocular disease are becoming even more pronounced. As a result, patients and physicians are seeking improved ocular therapeutics that can significantly enhance patient outcomes and convenience.
