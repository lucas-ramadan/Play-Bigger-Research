[Jaxtr](http://www.jaxtr.com) first launched in March 2007 with a widget that enables users to receive calls from their friends through a VOIP connection and keep their personal phone numbers private.  

In the past year, jaxtr has introduced a number of additional services in the attempt to monetize the company's 10 million users:

-Jaxtr helps users bypass expensive international phone charges by giving them free local numbers in the countries that they're calling to and charges a nominal fee for connection and the ability to call from a mobile phone. As a marketing ploy, the company permits free calls to other members.
-Jaxtr uses cafe jaxtr, a social network in which people call one another to discuss similar interests, and free global SMS to attract activity on its website and generate advertising revenue.

The company maintains an advantage over competitors such as [Skype](www.skype.com) by allowing customers to use any phone - mobile or landline - without the need to download software or maintain Internet access, and calling cards by eliminating the need to dial additional numbers and PIN codes.
