Founded in 2014, Envelop VR is creating productivity and enterprise software that enables businesses and consumers to create, work and play in an immersive, 3D environment. Envelop VR is the brainchild of serial entrepreneur Bob Berry, who studied virtual reality in Japan in the late 90s, and chief technology officer Jon Mavor, who has spent the last two decades in the video game business developing advanced rendering technologies.
