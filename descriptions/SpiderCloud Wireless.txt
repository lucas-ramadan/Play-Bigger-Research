SpiderCloud Wireless is the innovator behind a breakthrough, small-cell managed services platform that allows mobile operators to deliver scalable and unprecedented cellular and Wi-Fi coverage, capacity and cloud services to medium to large enterprises, wherever there's a LAN.

The E-RAN system consists of a Services Node (SCSN) that can control over 100 self-organizing and multi-access 3G, Wi-Fi and LTE/4G small cells that can be installed in just days using an enterprise- Ethernet Local Area Network (LAN). One E-RAN delivers unprecedented capacity and coverage to over 10,000 connected smartphones and tablets, with just one connection to the mobile operatorâ€™s core network. The scalable system architecture simplifies deployment and overall network configuration for mobile operators as they address pent-up demand for reliable mobile services from enterprise and large venue customers.

SpiderCloud is led by executives with successful track records at companies including Flarion Technologies, Qualcomm, Shasta Networks, FiberTower, Aperto Networks and Airvana. The company is privately funded and is based in San Jose, California, with offices in New Jersey and London.
