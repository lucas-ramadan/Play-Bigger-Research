**Business intelligence and shorter sales cycles for the contract process.**

Glider takes the pain out of managing sales contracts and brings visibility to the "last mile" of the sales funnel.

Glider provides finance and executive leadership with objective insight into which contracts will actually be signed by quarter-end, how many contracts are waiting on legal, how many are stuck in negotiations, and how many are out for final customer signatures. Glider reduces close times for reps by taking the focus away from process and putting it back on prospects. Companies can quickly create customizable workflows, setup contract approvals, collaborate on clause negotiations, and ultimately get e-signatures.

**Primary benefits include:**
• Shorter sales cycles 
• Better tracking and reporting for Finance 
• Objective KPIs for Sales, Finance, and Legal
