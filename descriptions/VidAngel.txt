Think Wikipedia for family-friendly video filters. VidAngel is powered by a volunteer community of avid fans of family-friendly video. Members of the community tag potentially offensive swearing, sex and violence in movies, TV shows and YouTube videos. These tags allow viewers to filter what they see and hear based on their personal values and content preferences. 

VidAngel is founded by the Harmon brothers, who are well known for creating the award winning YouTube sensation Girl’s Don’t Poop for Poo~Pourri (more than 27 million YouTube views) and co-founding Orabrush and Orapup, another award winning YouTube breakthrough. 

VidAngel will likely be interesting to Hollywood because it is expanding their market base here in the United States. “Hollywood is always trying to reach more viewers by cutting their films for different audiences,” explains Neal Harmon, CEO of VidAngel. “There is the Studio’s Final Cut for theaters. The Director’s Cut for the artists. The Airline and Broadcast Cut for the FCC. The Middle Eastern cut for Islam. The unrated cut for perverts. And fan cuts like people uploading just the sex scenes from Game of Thrones to YouTube.  It seems like there is a cut for everyone. But one major group was missing, a Family Cut for streaming. That is why we created VidAngel.”
