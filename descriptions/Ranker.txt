Ranker is a Quantcast Top 100 and growing (23+million monthly uniques) site that doubles as a consumer sentiment data-analysis machine. To consumers, Ranker is a fun, engaging site that empowers them to vote their opinions across deep rankings of things they are passionate about, but from a business point of view, Ranker is a first party data collection engine.

This graph is the most precise on the web in entertainment and food/beverage and has been successfully used to optimize ad spend on Facebook’s Audience Insights platform beyond Facebook’s targeting suggestions, among other uses. This data collected from millions of voters is also uniquely qualified to power or inform media recommendations (movies, TV, music).
