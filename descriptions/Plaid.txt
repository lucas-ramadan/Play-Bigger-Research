Plaid makes building financial technology simple by fixing the infrastructure of banks and credit cards. Using our REST API, developers can integrate in minutes and get high-quality transactional and account data from most major financial institutions. What's more - instead of the low-quality merchant strings you find in bank statements, Plaid gives high-context data for every transaction - including a cleaned merchant name, category, street address, geocode, date, and dollar value.
