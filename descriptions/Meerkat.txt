Meerkat (formerly AIR and Yevvo) is the best way to let the world experience what you see, with you. You can instantly push live video to your friends’ pockets and follow their lives in real-time.

Meerkat  is currently available for beta for iPhone and iPod touch. After installing Meerkat, you can sign up using your Facebook account or manually with an email address. Once you’ve logged in, you can find people to watch, broadcast your own videos, and more.
