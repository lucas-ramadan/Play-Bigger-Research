The founder of Omadi originally owned a private property impound company and he searched for a software to help manage his business. Dissatisfied with the available options, he set out to develop a custom software. The software helped his business become so successful that he transitioned to marketing and selling the Omadi Mobile Management system.
Since then, countless features have been added and refined. Because Omadi's platform is built on customization, it can be adapted to perfectly fit your business's needs. Omadi has also spread from towing into other markets as well, including private security enforcement. Contact Omadi today to see how we can help you streamline your business.
