Moleculera Labs provides personalized clinical testing services for individuals suspected of suffering from  PANDAS/PANS, which are treatable neurologic conditions that may be associated with motor tics, obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD) and sometimes Autism Spectrum Disorders. This perplexing neurologic condition is believed to be associated with an autoimmune response triggered by commonly occurring infections which result in a patientâ€™s antibodies targeting neurologic receptors in the body.

Over a decade of PANS and PANDAS testing, research has led to the development of the Cunningham Panel, a set of 5 clinical assays which serves as an aid to the physician in the diagnosis of these conditions. Moleculera Labs is continuing to work with researchers, patients and physicians to help understand the underlying biology of these autoimmune and neurologic conditions.  The overarching goal of Moleculera Labs is to assist children and their families to help restore an improved quality of life.
