Seismos, the K-wave Companyâ„¢, is a data analytics company for production optimization providing proprietary solutions enabling real-time, underground fluid flow monitoring, inside the reservoir, during production. Monitoring fluid movement with conventional seismic technologies requires months for data acquisition and processing, disrupts production and costs millions. Seismos breaks this paradigm and solves all problems associated with conventional methods by providing real-time information, at a fraction of the cost, through its proprietary, cloud-based K-wave technology that is non-invasive to production and to surface operations.
