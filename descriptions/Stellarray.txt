Stellarray develops and manufactures flat panel radiation sources and systems using them to solve important problems in irradiation and imaging.  Our first major product is a self-contained blood irradiator (SCBI) which uses our proprietary flat panel x-ray sources (FPXS) to ensure the safety of transfusion blood supplies.  SCBI will meet an urgent need in the blood transfusion market for a reliable, non-radioactive irradiator.   Other irradiators based on the SCBI architecture will be sold in the research, vaccine development, pharmaceutical and other markets.

We have other products in the pipeline that will use our digitally-addressable "smart x-ray sources" for CT systems with no moving parts to improve medical and industrial imaging.  These have been funded by government sources and strategic partners.
