Dekko was founded on the belief that society is entering an amazing transition in how they experience their technology. Smartphones and Tablets have ushered in the first taste of a "Post-PC" world, where their ability to connect to each other and to their favorite online services is mobile. They are beginning to experience entertainment, contextual information & personal interactions through natural interfaces that are not just "tiny screened PCs". Multi-sensor devices and The Internet of Things will provide the hardware foundation for true mobile operating systems. They are moving away from intermediated interfaces driven by keyboards and mice towards more natural and direct touch and voice interactions. Their most engaging sense, vision, will also experience a new natural interface, as content is placed in the world, in a truly believable manner.
