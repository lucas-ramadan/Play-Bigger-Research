In early 2014, Scripps purchased Newsy, a digital video news service that gave Scripps entry into the national news marketplace. The Columbia, Missouri-based startup serves a national digital audience with a curated approach to storytelling, and its video player can be found on many Scripps TV station websites. Newsy's engaging video news bites offer a broader view in a concise format. 

Through short video segments available on the web, mobile devices and OTT, Newsy advances the understanding of how a news story is covered by global media outlets - it offers context with convenience. 

Newsy received a 2014 and 2015 National Edward R. Murrow Award for Best Documentary. Newsy also has won Appy Awards, a Davey Award and a W3 Award. Its highly rated free apps are available from the Apple App Store, Google Play, the Windows Phone Marketplace and the Nokia Store.
