Remixation is the company behind [Showyou](/product/showyou), a delightful new app for the iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch. 

The company is focused on one central idea: that the best way to find videos is through people -- your friends, people you trust and like, or people who share your tastes and interests.

Showyou makes it easy and fun to watch video curated by your friends on Facebook, people you follow on Twitter, as well as videos made popular within the Showyou community. On the iPad, these videos are arranged in a distinctive two-dimensional video grid that has been hailed by critics and users alike as one of the most innovative experiences on the iPad.  It is available for the iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch. Using Airplay and Apple TV, you can use Showyou to watch videos on your television.

Previously, the team made [Vodpod.com](/product/vodpod), the leading video curation site on the web with over 1M hand-crafted video channels. Vodpod.com and related assets were [sold by Remixation to Lockerz in September 2011](http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/21/social-commerce-network-lockerz-acquires-personalized-video-curation-platform-vodpod/). 

Remixation is backed by TrueVentures and is based in San Francisco and Portland.
