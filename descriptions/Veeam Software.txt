**History**

Veeam was founded in 2006 by [Ratmir Timashev](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ratmir-timashev) and [Andrei Baronov](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/andrei-baronov), and originally had 10 employees. In August 2006, Veeam launched their first commercial product: Veeam Monitor. This application allowed monitoring and resource management for VMware Virtual Machines (VMs). A month later, Veeam announced a new product called FastSCP - a free tool to create and deploy ISO-based backup copies of VMs. FastSCP became extremely popular and widely used. In 2008, Veeam successfully launched [Veeam Backup & Replication](http://www.veeam.com/vm-backup-recovery-replication-software.html). This innovative product supported fast file-level recovery and VM migration inside VMware environments. Future focus was on the development and marketing for Veeam Backup & Replication. In 2010, Veeam Backup & Replication won the Best of Show and New Technology awards in VMworld. Veeam’s flagship product grew so quickly, it was used by more than 20,000 customers worldwide in 2011. Once Veeam Backup & Replication v6 was released, Veeam expanded its business to Microsoft Hyper-V users. As Veeam continued to grow, so did the awards, such as in 2012 where Veeam Backup & Replication won VMworld’s Best Virtualization and Server Consolidation, Best of Show and Best Virtualization for Disaster Recovery awards. Veeam Backup & Replication v7 was released in August 2013 and is used by more than 73,000 customers worldwide.
