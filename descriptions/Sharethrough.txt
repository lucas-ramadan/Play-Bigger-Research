Sharethrough is the largest & most sophisticated platform for in-feed, native monetization. Built for the new paradigm of modern content marketing, Sharethrough is a mobile-first, content-driven platform for advertisers to engage users with quality content, integrated natively to each site it lives on + for publishers to monetize with premium ads while maintaining a high quality user experience. 

The first building block of Sharethrough started at Stanford where Dan Greenberg and Rob Fan were teaching assistants in the first-ever "Facebook class". One of their core observations during this time was that the best performing monetization strategy for the applications they built was genuinely interesting sponsored content that was presented in a non-interruptive format. This learning led to the founding of Sharethrough and the company’s role in evangelizing the native advertising movement. 

With the mission of modernizing online advertising, Sharethrough has grown into one of the fastest growing technology companies with over 125 employees. We have built one of the world’s most sophisticated monetization software platforms, predicated on helping digital media as whole move beyond the pervasive model of interruptive, low value online advertising.
