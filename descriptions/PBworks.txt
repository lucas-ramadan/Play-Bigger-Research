A number of businesses and corporations use PBworks to create private wikis for employees; one case study described a legal firm which had transitioned to PBworks as a document management system in order to cut their IT costs. Clients also use PBworks as a host for internal documents, including CafePress.com, Capgemini, Deloitte, the Financial Times, Kiva, and Wideload Games while educational groups who are known to use PBworks include DePaul University, the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, the University of Toronto, the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, and Wayne State University.
