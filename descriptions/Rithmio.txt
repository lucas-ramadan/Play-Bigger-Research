DETAILS

Rithmio’s gesture recognition software works with motion-sensing devices such as wearables, smartphones or connected sports equipment to learn, track and analyze motion. Brands leverage Rithmio’s platform to create personalized and accurate gesture-based products. 


KEY FOCUS AREAS

1. Platform Helps Brands Innovate: Rithmio provides a platform for brands to create next generation products. From software licensing to big data analytics, our business model is focused on improving how brands build gesture recognition products and providing value for end users. 

2. Personalized Approach to Gesture Recognition: Rithmio’s software learns the unique nuances of how a user performs a specific gesture. As a result, gesture recognition is accurate for all ages and body types, be it an avid runner in her 30s or a sedentary man in his 70s. 

3. Ability to Learn New Gestures: With minimal user input, products powered by Rithmio can learn new user-defined gestures. Whether creating a gesture to interact naturally with a video game or to learn a user’s weight-lifting routine, Rithmio helps improve the desirability of gesture-based products by making them easy, personalized and intuitive. 


TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW

1. Automatic Learning: The software can learn models for new gestures in an unsupervised manner. The learning module may directly be used by an end user to define personalized gesture models, or by the brand’s product team to create gesture prototypes for its end customers. 

2. Recognition and Analysis: The recognition software can accurately distinguish and track gestures when they are performed by the user. The software also provides analysis such as the number of repetitions and comparison of the user’s form against a baseline.  

3. Cloud Repository for Gestures: Rithmio’s cloud architecture allows brands to datamine their user data to gain insights and improve their product offering.
